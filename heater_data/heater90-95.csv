"Mr. Heater Portable Buddy Outdoor Camping Propane Gas Heater Canada Version, Red",94.79,30-day returns,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

 Lasko Electric Portable Ceramic Oscillating Space Heater 1500-Watt Remote,91.07,Last item available,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater. And If I have to replace any one of the heaters I have, it will be with a Lasko 5572 heater.HJ of Missouri', ""We were absolutely thrilled with the size and capability of this room heater.

Keeps my whole RV toasty warm. I would recommend by a large propane tank to refill the 1 pound tanks. Much cheaper. But I’ve not been cold once. The safety feature of turning off it it tilts is great. Only problem I have found is the bottom piece you place on propane tank does not secure properly and falls off when lifted off the ground to move the heater. ', 'This little buddy heater is a fine unit for use in an ice fishing shelter or flip over sled / tent. It is the right size and has a small footprint.The angle of the head heating element is perfect for warming wet hands and can be easily aimed to direct the heater output.The only down side is that it can be difficult to light in even the slightest breeze.', ""This is just the right amount of heat and size  for my needs compared to the regular Mr. Heater but does not hold up to heavy use. Have had a regular size that I use in an icefishing house that has years of use on it. The little buddies I've had are lucky to make an ice season before getting had to light and the just quitting. Love the little buddies while they work but the regular Mr buddy is a much better long term value."", 'I bought this to heat my ice fishing hut and only used it a handful of times. Looks like it’s made pretty durable, the igniter works good, like the carry handle, the metal shield cools down pretty quick if you want to move spots. The negatives are the sensor for the automatic shut off is way too sensitive, if you dont have it pretty close to PERFECTLY flat it goes out which is a pain. Also there is no heat control so once it’s first lit it’s just barely staying lit, can’t have any wind blow on it or it goes out, plus once the honeycomb section is lit well finally and red it’s burning propane at such a low rate heat does not blow out of it, it only rises from it. I guess the plus to that is low propane consumption but it would be nice to be able to crank it up if you want to blow some heat at you.

The regular size Mr. Heater is more reliable and I should probably just stick with those but the smaller size and a bit less btu's just works better in my tiny and very well insulated fish house.Have tried the cleaning method described in the manual but it is very hard to take apart and nothing seems to help."", 'Bought 3 fir use to heat bedrooms in the house during power outages.

It will run for 6 hours on one propane bottle, so it will not last all night. However, if you start it at midnight, it will run until 6 AM, at which time you can turn on your furnace for a short time if you're an early riser.

Electric Space Heater 1500W Garage Forced Air Fan Portable Utility Home Shop New,92.29,30-day returns,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time.

Lasko Portable Electric Ceramic Oscillating Heater 1500W Digital Remote Control,91.07,30-day returns,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater. And If I have to replace any one of the heaters I have, it will be with a Lasko 5572 heater.HJ of Missouri', ""We were absolutely thrilled with the size and capability of this room heater.  It's a little taller than the other Lasko portable heater and our decision to get it was a good one. For our needs, this one is perfect. "", 'I really enjoy my heater.  I live in Arizona where it is getting cooler at night now.  It is very efficient and quiet.', 'Heats small area immediately in the morning, with an increase of 5-10 degrees in temperature within 15 minutes.  Easy to operate, with remote.  As usual: follow directions in the manufacturers manual for best results!', ""Wow, does this put out some heat, and like now..  Don't have to wait for anything to warm up  immediate heat..  2 modes low 900w and high 1500w..  Plus you can set it from 39 degrees to 90 degrees and to kick on automatically if room gets below set temp..  This can almost heat my whole house..  Will prob heat at least 3 rooms.Led readouts are bright and clear, fan, remote, oscillates, has real buttons, not plastic film that will wear out, and stands tall.  Has handle for easy moving.. With gas prices doubling this winter, I'm turning to a space heater so I can lower the thermostat.. "", 'great heater, used it all winter, no problems, good price, fast delivery', ""I don't have this exact model, but I have two similar Lesco 1500w heaters w/digital displays w/remotes.  I bought the second one because one of our tenants lost the remote.  One is #5165, the other one is #755320, the only complaint I have on this model is I had to stick a piece of foam tale on the top of the carrying slot in back so my finger wouldn't slip out of the carrying slot when carrying the heater.  The other heater's slot is angled so your fingers don't slip out.  The one remote does control either heater.  I recommended my satisfaction to a friend and he bought one and is happy with it.  I don't know his model #. I've had the first hater 5 yrs and the second one 2 yrs and both work great."", ""Great heater. Warms my garage better than expected.

"Mr. Heater Golf Cart Heater  4,000 BTU Stock Number: F242010 Model: Mh4gc",91.94,30-day returns,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.

I would recommend by a large propane tank to refill the 1 pound tanks. Much cheaper. But I’ve not been cold once. The safety feature of turning off it it tilts is great. Only problem I have found is the bottom piece you place on propane tank does not secure properly and falls off when lifted off the ground to move the heater. ', 'This little buddy heater is a fine unit for use in an ice fishing shelter or flip over sled / tent. It is the right size and has a small footprint.The angle of the head heating element is perfect for warming wet hands and can be easily aimed to direct the heater output.The only down side is that it can be difficult to light in even the slightest breeze.', ""This is just the right amount of heat and size  for my needs compared to the regular Mr. Heater but does not hold up to heavy use. Have had a regular size that I use in an icefishing house that has years of use on it. The little buddies I've had are lucky to make an ice season before getting had to light and the just quitting. Love the little buddies while they work but the regular Mr buddy is a much better long term value."", 'I bought this to heat my ice fishing hut and only used it a handful of times. Looks like it’s made pretty durable, the igniter works good, like the carry handle, the metal shield cools down pretty quick if you want to move spots. The negatives are the sensor for the automatic shut off is way too sensitive, if you dont have it pretty close to PERFECTLY flat it goes out which is a pain. Also there is no heat control so once it’s first lit it’s just barely staying lit, can’t have any wind blow on it or it goes out, plus once the honeycomb section is lit well finally and red it’s burning propane at such a low rate heat does not blow out of it, it only rises from it. I guess the plus to that is low propane consumption but it would be nice to be able to crank it up if you want to blow some heat at you. This is a new school version of a metal coffee can with a roll of toilet paper inside soaked in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol. ', ""These things do a good job of heating my small fish house, but it does not take long and they get hard to light and won't work Have gone through three in three ice fishing seasons.. The regular size Mr. Heater is more reliable and I should probably just stick with those but the smaller size and a bit less btu's just works better in my tiny and very well insulated fish house.Have tried the cleaning method described in the manual but it is very hard to take apart and nothing seems to help."", 'Bought 3 fir use to heat bedrooms in the house during power outages.

It seems to be the best match available of heat output needed for my collapsible fish house."", ""I used this in my motorhome to keep the chill off at night and not have to use the furnace, which runs the batteries down significantly while boon-docking. It will run for 6 hours on one propane bottle, so it will not last all night. However, if you start it at midnight, it will run until 6 AM, at which time you can turn on your furnace for a short time if you're an early riser. Alternatively, if you don't want to run the furnace in order to save batteries, you could light the burners on your stove. Be sure to crack a window so as not to deplete all the oxygen.

"F215120 Little Buddy Portable Propane Heater, 3,800-BTU - Quantity 1",90.64, ,"['Even though it cost almost 1 1/2 One Pound Coleman tanks from 9pm to 5am,  it’s great. Keeps my whole RV toasty warm. I would recommend by a large propane tank to refill the 1 pound tanks. Much cheaper. But I’ve not been cold once. The safety feature of turning off it it tilts is great. Only problem I have found is the bottom piece you place on propane tank does not secure properly and falls off when lifted off the ground to move the heater. ', 'This little buddy heater is a fine unit for use in an ice fishing shelter or flip over sled / tent. It is the right size and has a small footprint.The angle of the head heating element is perfect for warming wet hands and can be easily aimed to direct the heater output.The only down side is that it can be difficult to light in even the slightest breeze.', ""This is just the right amount of heat and size  for my needs compared to the regular Mr. Heater but does not hold up to heavy use. Have had a regular size that I use in an icefishing house that has years of use on it. The little buddies I've had are lucky to make an ice season before getting had to light and the just quitting. Love the little buddies while they work but the regular Mr buddy is a much better long term value."", 'I bought this to heat my ice fishing hut and only used it a handful of times. Looks like it’s made pretty durable, the igniter works good, like the carry handle, the metal shield cools down pretty quick if you want to move spots. The negatives are the sensor for the automatic shut off is way too sensitive, if you dont have it pretty close to PERFECTLY flat it goes out which is a pain. Also there is no heat control so once it’s first lit it’s just barely staying lit, can’t have any wind blow on it or it goes out, plus once the honeycomb section is lit well finally and red it’s burning propane at such a low rate heat does not blow out of it, it only rises from it. I guess the plus to that is low propane consumption but it would be nice to be able to crank it up if you want to blow some heat at you. This is a new school version of a metal coffee can with a roll of toilet paper inside soaked in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol. ', ""These things do a good job of heating my small fish house, but it does not take long and they get hard to light and won't work Have gone through three in three ice fishing seasons.. The regular size Mr. Heater is more reliable and I should probably just stick with those but the smaller size and a bit less btu's just works better in my tiny and very well insulated fish house.Have tried the cleaning method described in the manual but it is very hard to take apart and nothing seems to help."", 'Bought 3 fir use to heat bedrooms in the house during power outages.  Just arrived and a week later a planned one day power outage.  With new born baby, needed to ensure both mom and baby would stay warm.  Used the heater and it was fine.  ', ""I have the larger Mr. Heater for our sailboat works great! So I bought this for our RTT roof top tent ..works good don't get as hot which is good for a tent ,But! the base that holds the 1lb tank should be twice the size feels like it could fall over .I plan on fabricating a larger base :)                                                                        -=CC=-"", ""Not cheap. It is tippy with the 1 lb cylinder. I asked Mr Heater for a parts list to hard pipe it directly to a 5 lb or 20 lb cylinder and I got parts list for using a hose. I don't want to use a hose. I like that it is quiet. I like that you don't need matches. I wish it had more than 1 heat output setting. It seems to be the best match available of heat output needed for my collapsible fish house."", ""I used this in my motorhome to keep the chill off at night and not have to use the furnace, which runs the batteries down significantly while boon-docking. It will run for 6 hours on one propane bottle, so it will not last all night. However, if you start it at midnight, it will run until 6 AM, at which time you can turn on your furnace for a short time if you're an early riser. Alternatively, if you don't want to run the furnace in order to save batteries, you could light the burners on your stove. Be sure to crack a window so as not to deplete all the oxygen. This unit works well."", ""Light weight. Compact.It doesn't take up allot of space. Easy to use. Does a good job heating my Ice Fishing Hub perfectly.

Lasko Products 751320 Ceramic Tower Heater w Remote,90.84, ,"['I giving it 4 stars because when I started it for the first time.. It gave weird smell for about an hour or so. After that it has been working excellent. Its very easy to setup. Nothing much needed, just plug and start. It comes with a remote control using which we can control the temperature and speed. When I was at graduate school, my friend used to have it for his room since that room used to be cold in our apartment. It used to work fine there, so I purchased for my room at my current apartment. ', ""I really haven't had to use it yet, for my apartment gets very warm because of the sun coming in on my windows which face west, but I did try it out and it is certainly easy to use."", 'This is an awesome heater for the price that I have paid.Pros:1. It can warm up the room quickly with different temperature setup2. It has the auto feature where it goes to sleep mode when the temperature in room reaches the set value and restarts whenever it goes lower beyond the set value3. It can oscillate like a tower fan and distribute the heat across the room4. Its light weightCons:1. It has the remote but during night you cant see the temperature that we have set on this humidifier. Having a display in the remote or on the humidifier itself', ""This is the second one I've purchased. The heater itself is a good value, and the oscillating feature, and remote control are an added bonus. Used my first purchase in my camper (2 years and still going strong). This one's for our home's enclosed porch."", ""I think the heater works well, But when you have a power outage you have to reset it to keep area warm. The controls don't allow it to pick up where, hear left off trying to heat area.   So that make this heater, not reliable for keeping kids warm, pets,  plants.  In the areas I have lived would even help prevent frozen water lines.  I makes heater like this only good for you if, your attending it.  If this heat had manual controls it would be better. or had a program to reboot and maintain a pre-set temp,  by factory or,  by the user.  Myself I like a electric  heater that works  as lone as I have power.  And  starts back up after a power outage.  Have a great day."", ""This heater doesn't oscillate on all the temperatures. Only oscillates from 75 and up."", 'Got this heater for my camp trailer. Might as well use a candle for heat.  . It would be fine if it had a fan inside it.

Pelonis  space heater HO-0218  0706 Heater,95.0, ,"['I\'ve got two oil heaters in my house. I purchased this Pelonis model used. The other oil heater is a Lakewood that I purchased new. Both make a great supplement to the gas furnace that\'s designed to heat only one room of the house.This type of oil heater is pretty tough. They\'re not hard to find used and in good condition for around $20. You do, however, get what you pay for. This will heat a medium size bedroom so long as the windows are sealed properly. Mine doesn\'t have much control over the temperature, though. It seems to never be ""just right"". The 1500 watt Lakewood lacks the toe stubbing casters and does a better job of controlling the temperature.Still, though, if you find this heater used, it\'ll keep you warm.', ""I've only had it on for a few minutes, but it heated up.

I highly recommend this brand to all. Thank You.', 'better than forced air heaters in 1500w range.  creates even heat, less loss in heater.

Mr. Heater F271803 12ft Big Buddy Hose with RegulatorMulti,93.18, ,"[""I've had a Buddy heater for a couple years now, but hadn't worried about hooking up the BBQ grille tanks since I had a stockpile of the little camping propane cylinders from years of prepping. But this winter I realized we could be in for a few days without power like back in 1993, so I didn't feel secure about having enough gas to last. There are only two negatives I have with this hose, but it's still a five star product. The problems are:1) I wish it was longer. Placing the cylinder outside and running the hose through a window limits placement of the heater drastically with only tells feet of length.2) It takes quite a while to get the hose filled with propane to the point where the heater will light. That's to be expected, but that also means a fair amount of gas is lost when disconnecting.Neither of these two problems are really problems per se, just inconveniences.The heater is a really awesome unit. The hose just makes it exponentially better. Buy it."", ""I hooked it up to my LP bottle. You need to push the quick disconnect up until the slide moves up to lock it. It's a little tight but it is a good connection when complete. Bled the air out of the hose with a screwdriver in the quick disconnect. Then hooked it to the heater. It lit up quite quickly. Ran it through all the settings from Pilot, low, medium, to high. Worked very well. Has a nice pliable rubber hose, even in 30° temperature. A little pricey. Otherwise good. "", 'This was delivered a month ago and we have used it daily, until today..The regulator blew a diaphragm inside I guess and was shooting ice cold propane all over the place.  We were not even using it when this happened, luckily or we would have been blown up. Great hose, crappy regulator.  New one is 2 stage and set me back about $30. ', 'The new tank connection, righty tighty, lefty loosey,  is much easier to use.  Nice, well made hose and regulator combo. The quick disconnect end is also handy.', 'Males using Heater much easier', 'Exactly as described fit with no problem', 'Great product a must if u r going to use it alot', 'No Issues. Just a great product.

Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.

I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly.

NEW Lasko 5572 Room Heater Convection Ceramic Tower,94.98, ,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater. And If I have to replace any one of the heaters I have, it will be with a Lasko 5572 heater.HJ of Missouri', ""We were absolutely thrilled with the size and capability of this room heater.  It's a little taller than the other Lasko portable heater and our decision to get it was a good one. For our needs, this one is perfect. "", 'I really enjoy my heater.  I live in Arizona where it is getting cooler at night now.  It is very efficient and quiet.', 'Heats small area immediately in the morning, with an increase of 5-10 degrees in temperature within 15 minutes.  Easy to operate, with remote.  As usual: follow directions in the manufacturers manual for best results!', ""Wow, does this put out some heat, and like now..  Don't have to wait for anything to warm up  immediate heat..  2 modes low 900w and high 1500w..  Plus you can set it from 39 degrees to 90 degrees and to kick on automatically if room gets below set temp..  This can almost heat my whole house..  Will prob heat at least 3 rooms.Led readouts are bright and clear, fan, remote, oscillates, has real buttons, not plastic film that will wear out, and stands tall.  Has handle for easy moving.. With gas prices doubling this winter, I'm turning to a space heater so I can lower the thermostat.. "", 'great heater, used it all winter, no problems, good price, fast delivery', ""I don't have this exact model, but I have two similar Lesco 1500w heaters w/digital displays w/remotes.  I bought the second one because one of our tenants lost the remote.  One is #5165, the other one is #755320, the only complaint I have on this model is I had to stick a piece of foam tale on the top of the carrying slot in back so my finger wouldn't slip out of the carrying slot when carrying the heater.  The other heater's slot is angled so your fingers don't slip out.  The one remote does control either heater.  I recommended my satisfaction to a friend and he bought one and is happy with it.  I don't know his model #. I've had the first hater 5 yrs and the second one 2 yrs and both work great."", ""Great heater. Warms my garage better than expected.

Comfort Zone 5000 Watt Fan-Forced 240V Ceiling Mount Hard-wired Heater CZ220~!,94.98, ,"[""easy install, seems to be made well.  love the three heat settingsall parts were present and was packaged well. upon install, turned on power, turned thermostat knob and bam...had instant heat as I had expected...bring on the cold!!.however, one feature that I wish it had was a delayed fan off to cool the heating coils after use. when you rotate the thermostat knob, the fan shuts down immediately, leaving the hot coils to cool off too slowly. also, the unit I received didn't have a visible mark on the thermostat knob for easy identification of position (easily fixed). overall, nice product for the money"", ""So much easier than installing a gas furnace and vent.  Fan creates a full circular heat draft all the way around my 20x20 detached garage.  Heats up quickly and I can then turn it down.  Thermostat works well.  I had a 30 amp welder plug in a good location, so mounted it on the ceiling and used a 10' dryer plug cord.  Quick and easy installation.  Should have done this years ago.  No more freezing with a little space heater."", 'I recommend knowledgäble HVAC guy to add the external thermostat if you need one.  I have high ceilings and wanted to use my mouting system that âttaches to the walls in a corner - no ceiling holes, but two nights of engineering the aluminum mounts.  Hester has been set on low since I installed it and let the Honeywell electronic thermostât do the work.  Waiting for ã heating bill to begin tuning it for optimãl settings depending on weather.  But garage can get hot it works so well.', ""I purchased this heater to use in a 666 sq ft, 4-car, uninsulated, vaulted ceiling garage.  Obviously this is meant to be used in a smaller, more insulated setting.  I wanted to try just one first, and then add as necessary.The heater itself seems to be well-built as far as structure, and designed well as far as installation and operation.  Including running wiring and building a wall mount (vaulted ceiling so no ceiling studs), it took 2-3hrs to get up and running.In my large uninsulated setting, over the course of 3-4hrs, it was able to raise the temperature from 25*F to 45*F, roughly speaking.  In other words, from intolerable to tolerable.  Which is about what I expected from it.  I think it would do quite well at maintaining a higher temperature if I were to use my propane 'salamander' to initially heat the space.Based on other's reviews and my own experience, there seems to be a major quality control concern in the assembly line for these regarding the fan nut.  I was unaware of this until after it was installed, but I'm almost certain I have the same issue as almost everyone else.  Before mounting the heater there was a nut and washer rattling around inside.  After a semi-thorough check, I figured it was an erroneous leftover.  Having read the reviews and after hearing a small rattle when the heater runs, I will be dismounting and tearing it down to install that nut properly.  This is both an inconvenience and really a potential danger.  For that I've removed a star from the rating.That being said, I will be purchasing another one, possibly two more.  Can't beat the price to performance ratio anywhere.Edit from the future:  I bought another one, slightly updated since the first.  This one had no problems and even runs quieter.  Awesome."", ""This heater does a great job heating my 24'x30' insulated shop. I have it on a Honeywell line thermostat, and typically keep it at 40* to keep water lines from freezing, but when I'm ready to work in the ship I just turn it up and in 20 minutes it's nice and toasty. The other day it was 30* outside, but on high this ran for less than 5 minutes every 20-30 minutes.The only potential negative to be aware of is that it has a slight whistle when it's running. It's enough that I think about it every time it starts up, but it's not enough to be a nuisance.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase; it was easy to install, and is cost-effective for the job I needed it to do."", ""Fast shipping.Well packaged.All metal construction.Enough detail in instructions,easily installed,best of all:heater works great.No issues so far.I heat a decent size 2 car garage and this is all I need.Recomend a ceiling fan to force the heat down,same thing with all of 'em.I can not stand beneath this heater when it is on high,it is way beyond my expectations.It is not very big or impressive,but do not let that part fool ya,it is a good heater.I have left the thermostat inside the heater,so far this is working fine."", 'I have used 4 times now and I really like it. If you have a insulated two car garage this heater will do the job nicely.It only took about 30 minutes to go from 30° to  62° in an hour it was 71° had to turn it down to work though. I like it 57° to 63° when working on a project. This heater is perfect for my needs. Little less than $100 too!👍', ""I'm happy with this heater and wish I'd found it years ago. I installed it in my basement workshop and it is way better than the big baseboard heater and kerosene heater I'd been using for many years. It's quiet and easy to install and heats the basement better than I'd anticipated. The workmanship and quality are great and I especially like that the sheet metal parts are post painted as opposed to crummy pre-paint and so all the sheet metal cut edges and corners are painted and nice and smooth and burr free."", 'I use this heater turned down low just to knock the edge off the cold so I can work comfortably in my 3 car garage shop.  I have it set on about 1/3 of its capacity and it keeps the garage at about 55- 60, the way I like it.  If I were to turn it up on high it would make the garage toasty warm.  The installation was straight forward and simple.  I bought a plug, 15 ft. of 10-3 service cord and a cord grip to make the installation. I plug it into my 220 volt welder receptacle when I want to have heat.  Wish I had found it years ago.', 'Great heat output, replaced my floor oil heater and small plug in with this one.  Only reason I gave it a 4 not 5 is that # 1 the fan blade was loose when I got it and the simple mechanism makes a rattling noise that is not necessary.  It only has a moving fan part but is kinda noisy.  Heats very well.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Broan 157 1250W Electric Radiant Ceiling Heater - Gray,90.0, ,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation. The power to the heater tested good.', ""Love this little heater, just renivating my Mum's home.   It's so nice to have this little heater in the basement bath.  Very reasonable in price and a nice touch!!!"", 'Brand new unused, unopened.  Excellent purchase. ', 'The Broan 157 ceiling heater is a great upgrade from the "" twisted wire element "" heater. This unit has a solid element like on a stove top burner and heats my bathroom better.  You will be very happy with this unit.']","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.

Edenpure Gen 2 A5095 Infrared Heater. No Remote Control Tested,90.0, ,"[""This is a great heater. This is actually our 2nd one. We loved the 1st one so much that we decided to purchase another.  It does a good job of heating our living area. It doesn't seem to increase our electric bills by much. And it's much cheaper to use than heater fuel. I would recommend this heater for any one. "", 'Purchased this to supplement heat in my cold basement (I live in Michigan). It does the job for that quite well.  Not sure how the energy use will be as I have not been billed yet. I like that it is quiet.  I am using it to supplement the heat in an area that is considerably larger than what the heater should heat, but since it is a supplemental heat source, it works great maintaining a comfortable temperature in the entire area. The timer option is useful and the fact that it is thermostatically controlled (digital readout, so you know what the setting actually is) is good. It was a good investment for my purposes, as otherwise it would be difficult to spend much time in my basement workshop in the winter.', 'I have used this brand and model in my greenhouse for several years. The thermostat control protects my tender plants and turns off in the hot sun. I use this product from Mid-February through Mid-May.', 'I bought this heater not knowing what to expect, but it has done an excellent job. I ended up buying 2 and I am heating a 2400 square ft building with 2 of them. They run quiet, and are cool to the touch. I am really pleased with them.', ""My friend has the older version edenPure (same BTU) and it puts out a LOT of heat. The gen 2? Not so much... I bought the gen 2 based on the brand, and I'm not impressed at all. I think I would have been better off with a cheap ceramic heater for a lot less $."", ""I really like this heater. It is my second Eden Pure. It heats up my apartment so quickly and is so quiet.I love the size too. I have barely had to use it because Winter hasn't gotten here yet!"", 'It does an OK job of keeping the chill off, no where near as good as the last edenpure I had. It would warm you right up and lasted for many years. This one just does not have the same power that one did. But like I say when it is too warm for the CH and too chilly for nothing it does the job.', 'These are awesome heaters, I had one of the first ones when they came out, loved it, one of the good things about these heaters is that you can gets parts for them if ever you need them but I can say that it will be a long time before you will ever need to, I would recommend buying one.', 'This is a very efficient way to heat your home or office.   Quiet fan motor, very light andportable.    Wheel kits are available for even easier handling.   We have been usingEden Pure for 10 years and have no complaints.   Good deal for a good price.', ""Heats my sunroom very nicely. Have to turn it down most of the time. Good heater for the money.

Lasko 755320 Ceramic Space Heater with Digital Display and Remote Control ,90.99,30-day returns,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time!

Works great for the rooms we are in....nice and warm, keeps us comfortable. We use to minimize our heating bill and still stay comfortable. Would not hesitate to buy another if I should find I need one. Nice to have the portable heat source that we can also control temp with the adjustable settings. The safety tip switch is another great feature.The unit is quite.', 'I bought this as a replacement for the same brand and model of heater that quit working after many years of use.  I love how quiet the heater is and how it spreads heat around a room without having a hot area only in front of the heater.  It is also lightweight and safe as the heater itself stays cool, and it has a tip over safety feature as well.', 'These are no good heaters. I have had to replace one every 4 winters, due to it just stops working. They show they are getting power, but the fan and heat does not come on. One year two went out the same way. For the price you pay you would think you are getting a well made product. I bought a cheap Polonis heater and will see how long it lasts.', 'It did a good job of heating up the room, but the off gassing was 100% poison.   I ran it outside for 4 hours thinking that would get rid of the off gassing, but it continued for 3 days. It gave me a headache, and I could taste it in my mouth.  I replaced it with a ceramic heater, and there is no off gassing.', 'Claims rooms up to 220sqft but no way lucky 140sqft room gets even any circulation of warm air if any luke warm air.Nice protection features on this unit as for all overall bathroom small bedroom it’s okNothing else', 'Haven\'t had it long enough to really work it out.  It is very quiet, it heats a bathroom very quickly from around 50 to 75 in just a few minutes. Of course the larger the room the longer it will take, but it ""throws"" heat nicely.  It feels very well built compared to other, admittedly cheaper, heaters i\'ve had in the past. I think the best compliment is, you don\'t even notice it\'s there, it just works.', 'This is the second Vornado that we have purchased. The first one only lasted 22 years! Does a fine job of heating a small room. Fan is relatively quiet. Only complaint is that it collects dust on the fan blades. Case is sealed so there is no way other than perhaps compressed air to clean the blades.', 'My old oil filled heater went out so I purchased this Vornado after so many good reviews.  It works okay but I thought it would put out more heat.  If I had to do this over again I would say no.', 'What I saw is what I got: pictures were accurate but also the consumer reviews I looked up.

"Lasko 755320 Ceramic Space Tower Heater, 8.5″L x 7.25″W x 23″H, Silver",93.34,30-day returns,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit. The Oscillation can be Set by The Remote as well. PROS: Great Designed Unit.

Keeps my whole RV toasty warm. I would recommend by a large propane tank to refill the 1 pound tanks. Much cheaper. But I’ve not been cold once. The safety feature of turning off it it tilts is great. Only problem I have found is the bottom piece you place on propane tank does not secure properly and falls off when lifted off the ground to move the heater. ', 'This little buddy heater is a fine unit for use in an ice fishing shelter or flip over sled / tent. It is the right size and has a small footprint.The angle of the head heating element is perfect for warming wet hands and can be easily aimed to direct the heater output.The only down side is that it can be difficult to light in even the slightest breeze.', ""This is just the right amount of heat and size  for my needs compared to the regular Mr. Heater but does not hold up to heavy use. Have had a regular size that I use in an icefishing house that has years of use on it. The little buddies I've had are lucky to make an ice season before getting had to light and the just quitting. Love the little buddies while they work but the regular Mr buddy is a much better long term value."", 'I bought this to heat my ice fishing hut and only used it a handful of times. Looks like it’s made pretty durable, the igniter works good, like the carry handle, the metal shield cools down pretty quick if you want to move spots. The negatives are the sensor for the automatic shut off is way too sensitive, if you dont have it pretty close to PERFECTLY flat it goes out which is a pain. Also there is no heat control so once it’s first lit it’s just barely staying lit, can’t have any wind blow on it or it goes out, plus once the honeycomb section is lit well finally and red it’s burning propane at such a low rate heat does not blow out of it, it only rises from it. I guess the plus to that is low propane consumption but it would be nice to be able to crank it up if you want to blow some heat at you. This is a new school version of a metal coffee can with a roll of toilet paper inside soaked in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol. ', ""These things do a good job of heating my small fish house, but it does not take long and they get hard to light and won't work Have gone through three in three ice fishing seasons.. The regular size Mr. Heater is more reliable and I should probably just stick with those but the smaller size and a bit less btu's just works better in my tiny and very well insulated fish house.Have tried the cleaning method described in the manual but it is very hard to take apart and nothing seems to help."", 'Bought 3 fir use to heat bedrooms in the house during power outages.  Just arrived and a week later a planned one day power outage.  With new born baby, needed to ensure both mom and baby would stay warm.  Used the heater and it was fine.

So I bought this for our RTT roof top tent ..works good don't get as hot which is good for a tent ,But! the base that holds the 1lb tank should be twice the size feels like it could fall over .I plan on fabricating a larger base :)                                                                        -=CC=-"", ""Not cheap. It is tippy with the 1 lb cylinder. I asked Mr Heater for a parts list to hard pipe it directly to a 5 lb or 20 lb cylinder and I got parts list for using a hose. I don't want to use a hose. I like that it is quiet. I like that you don't need matches. I wish it had more than 1 heat output setting. It seems to be the best match available of heat output needed for my collapsible fish house."", ""I used this in my motorhome to keep the chill off at night and not have to use the furnace, which runs the batteries down significantly while boon-docking. It will run for 6 hours on one propane bottle, so it will not last all night. However, if you start it at midnight, it will run until 6 AM, at which time you can turn on your furnace for a short time if you're an early riser. Alternatively, if you don't want to run the furnace in order to save batteries, you could light the burners on your stove. Be sure to crack a window so as not to deplete all the oxygen. This unit works well."", ""Light weight. Compact.It doesn't take up allot of space. Easy to use. Does a good job heating my Ice Fishing Hub perfectly.

Presto 07924 Heat Dish plus Parabolic Electric Heater( used- 99%new),95.0, ,"[""I use this heater in my clinic and my patients absolutely love it. It's amazing how quickly it heats a room without air blasting or noise. It has a nice safety feature where it makes a horrible noise if it's tipping over (it only happens if I'm moving it when it's on). In fact several of my patients have gone out and bought their own for home. I should get a commission."", 'I have an old 1911 craftsman style house with no insulation.  My heating system is an outdated oil furnace.  As we all know the price of fuel is always fluctuating and seems like it is going to stay that way.  It costs me about $300.00 a month in the winter.  Which is ridiculous, especially when the heat just does not stay in the house for long.I needed a knew plan and changing out the heat system or insulating the house is not an option at this time.  So I went out and bought the presto heatdish.  It produces so much heat that during the winter I no longer had to heat the entire house to stay warm.  I would just carry the heatdish around with me, saving me hundreds of dollars month to month.  I had a few other electric heaters before I purchased this one and the difference is night and day.I  have had this heater for almost 3 years now and it still works as well as the day I purchased it.  It paid for itself in its first week work.  With as much use as this gets I would of expected it to burn out a while ago, but that is not the case.The drawbacks: It does not have an automatic turn off system if it were to fall over, but it does have an alarm that is unmistakably loud.   There is also a footlight that you cannot turn off or on, but you can just take out the lightbulb if that bothers you.Great product and highly recommended. Thanks for reading.', ""Proven, ancient technology that outperforms the daylights of newer, highly rated products. It's effective (heats the room quickly and thoroughly), efficient (only 1,000 watts), safe (automatic shut-off features), and built to last. Sometimes a product cannot be improved upon.  "", 'It gives off a good amount of heat but it has one big design flaw where the dish can not be tilted. This means the dish is in a fixed position which points into the air slightly. So if the surface you place it on is taller than you are while seated you will struggle to feel it. The safety tip over buzzer also prevents you from sliding something underneath it to tilt it yourself.', ""This is a wonderful heater.  I am a smoker and visit my family a lot.  I choose to smoke in the garage there and my sister in law bought this for me to use in the garage. It warms up quickly for the immediate area and it doesn't take long for the surrounding areas to warm up either. Once this gets going I don't even need a coat.  (Ohio area)  I have a house with very tall ceilings in the master bedroom and living area.  In the winter this little heater warms up quickly, even going right to the high setting.  I always have to turn it way back too.  I am widowed now and I don't need to keep the entire house warm, just where I am.  I do recommend this.  Oh, it is safe, if you move it at all when it is on you get a loud buzz sound!  If on the fence about it I would go with it."", 'Great price, lightweight, energy efficient. It has worked very well so far. The price was the best I found on Ebay. I think the design is very good. The shape of the dish plus the shiny interior helps it be much more efficient than a regular space heater. It gets very hot very fast. It also has a buzzer in case it tips over. A great all around heater to warm a person up fast.', ""These are fabulous heaters (radiant warmth, like the sun) and are in great condition.At first they didn't quite meet my needs, because I needed them to point straight ahead, whereas they are angled slightly upward and this is not adjustable. However, I set each heater on a slanted platform (which I made out of heavy cardboard), and now they meet my needs perfectly. (Parabolic heat dish heaters warm whatever is directly in front of them, within about, say, 15 feet.) You won't believe how much glowing warmth they put out!Also, Rob was great to do business with."", ""I live in a 1920's craftsman style house with poor insulation. This heater is wonderful and has allowed me to turn my thermostat down several degrees and still be comfortable here in Minnesota. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could because it is actually a little bit large to walk around in a small house with small rooms.  But that said, even set as low as it will go, it still puts out a lot of heat. In fact, I have to be careful not to put it in a room near my thermostat because the furnace will not come on at all if I do!  I have already recommended it to friends."", 'This heat dish pumps out heat so intensely it’s like a dryer for your cloths if sitting in front of it. I could feel it’s radiant heat from about 15ft away. Wayyyy better than other heat dish I had no contest. It does not oscillate and no remote only 2 features not on this probably because it is heavy duty. This is the best heat dish, look no further. ', ""I had a socially distanced bourbon tasting party for four on my back patio during January 2021 in Chicago. My neighbor had two of the Presto dishes so I ordered two more. Even though the evening's temperature dipped into the mid-20s, all four of us were completely comfortable sitting in our patio chairs with a our own Presto dish to keep us warm. The next day I ordered two more dishes to complete my set.""]","Used: An item that has been used previously.

Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.  Am not able to determine if I am saving money on this product or not running it continuously versus other types of heating methods.

"Mr. Heater MH9BX 9000 BTU Propane Portable Buddy Heater, MH9BX (RED)",90.97,7 watchers,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

2-Pack Allied Precision 742G Bucket Water Heater,94.85, ,"['It does heat a bucket pretty good. Not in minutes, but in the course of several minutes. Wont heat up the bathtub hardly. Uses a lot of power. The product should put better labeling on it... Or at least in a manual. My brother burnt himself picking it up. Also, it fails to show how to properly immerse it. Is it supposed to stand up or can it float on its side? Is there a water level limit? Can the handle be submerged. The plastic part is the handle, right?', 'I wanted a bucket heater that keeps the water from freezing over in a livestock bucket.  The instructions that came with it said to not submerge this heater into a bucket or receptacle that cannot handle ""boiling water"".  It said the heater will maintain that temperature and the auto turn off valve will prevent the temperature from dropping too low to freeze.  So, I plugged it into a 5 gallon bucket of water and it heated up way too hot for any animal to want to drink it.  I then put it in a 25 gallon bucket and the same thing happened, although not boiling, was still too hot for any pasture animal to drink.  The box showed a horse on it and I can tell  you right now, none of my horses drink hot coffee, tea, OR plain water.  I have no idea what purpose this heater has and when I called to report it there was no one there at the time to help me and I was promised  call back to discuss the findings.  No call ever came.  I would like to return it but refuse to pay return shipping on such a ridiculous product.  I will shop elsewhere.SJH', 'This works well for small bodies of water.  It was in a 25 gallon water tank for 24 hours and was just warm.  The ambient temperature was 55 degrees.  I was thinking it would be at a boil way before that, after reading the description.
