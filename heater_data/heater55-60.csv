The usual temperature here during winter nights goes between 35 to 40 something degrees Fahrenheit. I use it to warm up a small room (10 feet x 10 feet x 8 feet, without insulation).

I’m very happy with this heater.', ""I've had many space heaters over the years, but this one is a gem: a high-quality product that works well and quickly. It's the quietest heater I've ever had. The oscillating heating tower guarantees the whole room gets warm. The tower design is sleek, and the whole unit takes up little space. This machine has heft and seems well made. Though it's about 3-times taller than it is wide, most of the weight is in the base, which makes it feel solid and not prone to tipping over easily. I'm so in love with this baby that I'm buying a second -- FOR MY 3-ROOM APARTMENT!! lolI wholeheartedly recommend this product."", ""Received this tower fan and it's very sturdy, has several settings: air, low heat and higher heat.

I would recommend it to others!  ', ""Almost bought the more expensive model because it came with a remote. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and found one in here!

PELONIS Electric 1500W Oil Filled Radiator Heater with Safety Protection LED ...,58.65,Last item available,"['Good unit, uses low power on economy setting. I place it in front of a fan to move the heat around my room. Good for 100 to 150 square feet or so, anything larger and I would get a more powerful unit. I have never had to go over 75 degrees on the setting and it has a built in thermometer so it will turn off when it reaches the settings temperature. I keep it close to where I use it so no need form the remote though that is a good extra. Also has a built in timer as well. Great little unit for the money!  Would be nice to have more specific temperature settings for thermometer other than increments of 5. But great unit for my room.', ""Great product. Power settings include 1500W and 900W options for quick warm up and then keeping temp at comfort level. Remote control makes it easier to operate. But the best part - it's absolutely quiet, 0(zero) Db!

I would recommend this product to others.', 'No cons, but lots of pros regarding this heater.  I purchased it to keep my 2-car garage above 32 F degrees during the harsh, Wisconsin winters.  It has served its purpose for the past 3 years. I have run it on Hi - 70 degrees to do this, and it has worked well.   It keeps the electric bill down, plus all my recreational toys safe from the freezing temperatures during the winter.  Of course, I follow all of the safety recommendations that include nothing around it for 3ft.  It is dependable, and does the job.  I would recommend this model over all of the no-name models, as PELONIS is an american company who designs their equipment themselves, and ensures that everything is built tough with good materials.', 'My Mom loves it  placed in her bedroomset the controls and slept the night away.easy to assembly and work.  just setthe temp, time and relax the night away.jealous hers has a remote', 'Great Value !!!,... timer set on and off times,... remote control !!!! buy this!!!!save money on utility bills 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻', ""I love this heater .

Now it is very toasty.  The slate is warm to the touch.  I've tried other heaters .. with not much luck.  But I have to say .. this thing works pretty darn good for being on Eco mode .. which is only 600 watts .

Mr. Heater F271803 Big Buddy 12ft Hose with Regulator,57.0,Money Back Guarantee,"[""I've had a Buddy heater for a couple years now, but hadn't worried about hooking up the BBQ grille tanks since I had a stockpile of the little camping propane cylinders from years of prepping. But this winter I realized we could be in for a few days without power like back in 1993, so I didn't feel secure about having enough gas to last. There are only two negatives I have with this hose, but it's still a five star product. The problems are:1) I wish it was longer. Placing the cylinder outside and running the hose through a window limits placement of the heater drastically with only tells feet of length.2) It takes quite a while to get the hose filled with propane to the point where the heater will light. That's to be expected, but that also means a fair amount of gas is lost when disconnecting.Neither of these two problems are really problems per se, just inconveniences.The heater is a really awesome unit. The hose just makes it exponentially better. Buy it."", ""I hooked it up to my LP bottle. You need to push the quick disconnect up until the slide moves up to lock it. It's a little tight but it is a good connection when complete. Bled the air out of the hose with a screwdriver in the quick disconnect. Then hooked it to the heater. It lit up quite quickly. Ran it through all the settings from Pilot, low, medium, to high. Worked very well. Has a nice pliable rubber hose, even in 30° temperature. A little pricey. Otherwise good. "", 'This was delivered a month ago and we have used it daily, until today..The regulator blew a diaphragm inside I guess and was shooting ice cold propane all over the place.  We were not even using it when this happened, luckily or we would have been blown up. Great hose, crappy regulator.  New one is 2 stage and set me back about $30. ', 'The new tank connection, righty tighty, lefty loosey,  is much easier to use.  Nice, well made hose and regulator combo. The quick disconnect end is also handy.', 'Males using Heater much easier', 'Exactly as described fit with no problem', 'Great product a must if u r going to use it alot', 'No Issues.

Comfort Zone Electric Tower Heater Built-in Safety Adjustable Thermostat 1500-W,59.38,30-day returns,"[""This a very cost effective space heater to warm any area during a chilly winter, or - as we had during the early part of the Wisconsin spring - a slightly nippy start to spring. It works to warm a bedroom, normal sized living room (unsure of those with an open plan large setting), or a small area of a basement that you are working in. It has three settings, and has tip-over &amp; overheat protection. I like this product an awful lot, and thus I'll give it 4.5 stars. It does NOT have a remote, but I bought a separate one for that purpose. I am taking a half of a star off because EVEN though it does have tip over protection (meaning it shuts off in that case), it is slightly more easy to tip over than I thought it was. So if you have pets, it might NOT be the BEST idea to use it when they are out playing - NOT so much for safety sake, but to prevent your fur baby from getting injured stepping on it."", 'Works very well and set up takes only a few minutes...', ""This will be my last one.

Comfort Zone Heater Radiant Tower Space Heat Automatic Fuss-Free Operation,57.99,37 sold,"[""This a very cost effective space heater to warm any area during a chilly winter, or - as we had during the early part of the Wisconsin spring - a slightly nippy start to spring. It works to warm a bedroom, normal sized living room (unsure of those with an open plan large setting), or a small area of a basement that you are working in. It has three settings, and has tip-over &amp; overheat protection. I like this product an awful lot, and thus I'll give it 4.5 stars. It does NOT have a remote, but I bought a separate one for that purpose. I am taking a half of a star off because EVEN though it does have tip over protection (meaning it shuts off in that case), it is slightly more easy to tip over than I thought it was. So if you have pets, it might NOT be the BEST idea to use it when they are out playing - NOT so much for safety sake, but to prevent your fur baby from getting injured stepping on it."", 'Works very well and set up takes only a few minutes...', ""This will be my last one.

MR. HEATER Big Buddy Hose W/Reg,57.5,38 sold,"[""I've had a Buddy heater for a couple years now, but hadn't worried about hooking up the BBQ grille tanks since I had a stockpile of the little camping propane cylinders from years of prepping. But this winter I realized we could be in for a few days without power like back in 1993, so I didn't feel secure about having enough gas to last. There are only two negatives I have with this hose, but it's still a five star product. The problems are:1) I wish it was longer. Placing the cylinder outside and running the hose through a window limits placement of the heater drastically with only tells feet of length.2) It takes quite a while to get the hose filled with propane to the point where the heater will light. That's to be expected, but that also means a fair amount of gas is lost when disconnecting.Neither of these two problems are really problems per se, just inconveniences.The heater is a really awesome unit. The hose just makes it exponentially better. Buy it."", ""I hooked it up to my LP bottle. You need to push the quick disconnect up until the slide moves up to lock it. It's a little tight but it is a good connection when complete. Bled the air out of the hose with a screwdriver in the quick disconnect. Then hooked it to the heater. It lit up quite quickly. Ran it through all the settings from Pilot, low, medium, to high. Worked very well. Has a nice pliable rubber hose, even in 30° temperature. A little pricey. Otherwise good. "", 'This was delivered a month ago and we have used it daily, until today..The regulator blew a diaphragm inside I guess and was shooting ice cold propane all over the place.  We were not even using it when this happened, luckily or we would have been blown up. Great hose, crappy regulator.  New one is 2 stage and set me back about $30. ', 'The new tank connection, righty tighty, lefty loosey,  is much easier to use.  Nice, well made hose and regulator combo. The quick disconnect end is also handy.', 'Males using Heater much easier', 'Exactly as described fit with no problem', 'Great product a must if u r going to use it alot', 'No Issues.

I like heavy. 90% of the space heaters on the market are flimsy units with cheap thermostats that burn out in a year because they're constantly kicking on &amp; off.

Best for rooms where you want to maintain a constant temperature, but it doesn't mind being cranked up either.If you have to shut it off, I recommend switching to FAN for a few minutes as a cool-down cycle.I got my first Pelonis brand-new in the box for $5 at a yard sale.

Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,60.0, ,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!  More than pleased hubby here...........""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Vornado MVH Vortex Heater W/ 3 Heat Settings Adjustable Thermostat Tip Over Prot,59.99, ,"['I live in Nebraska and put the Vornado in a 25’x12’ ventless corner basement room with 4 windows. It works adequately for that room. It takes 10-15 minutes on the high setting to heat entire room so I can’t imagine ever using the low setting there. Maybe in a smaller room or camper or a warmer climate it would be needed. The Vornado is so quiet and the heating element hardly glows, that when first turned on I wasn’t sure it was working. It has a safety switch on the bottom and needs to be placed on a hard flat surface. It’s very compact and the plastic exterior makes it lightweight. That exterior though doesn’t seem real sturdy so I’ve got it up off the floor to avoid getting kicked or trod on. For the price and purpose I’m satisfied.', ""After searching for a year for a replacement for our beloved Braun heater we have finally found one that works well. The Vornado is not the design leader that the old Braun was but it does come close on one of the most important features for us. We use this heater in a quiet office environment, therefore the heater has to be quiet. We tried a popular Fasco, a Caframo that is styled after the Braun, and other brands. All were too noisy. The Vornado is not whisper silent like the Braun, but it come close. The noise level is about like a modern computer.Other features we like on the Vornado are the 3 heat settings, a fairly accurate thermostat and a decent length cord. The design is upright where the Braun was low. The vertical design with the large blade fan helps the Vornado more more air which helps warm up the room more quickly. It has a discrete small red led light that lets you know it's on. The heater is made in China.The downsides of this heater are minor. The heat range selector switch is not intuitive and dimly marked. You need to shine a light on it and maybe consult the manual to remember what the cryptic I, II, III markings mean. (I=low, II=med, III=high). And the case is shiny plastic which is a static electricity magnet. It attracts dust and animal hair easily. These are small issues. We normally leave the unit on one heat setting and it is under the desk, so pretty much out of sight. The black case helps it hide. Overall the heater looks to be well made and it's doing its job well. The price is a little high for a simple heater, but we are happy with it."", ""This is the third one of these I have bought. While it has a maximum of 1500 watts, these heat a room the most evenly of anything you can buy. It is quiet and you won't get burned like other heaters. "", ""This is my second Vornado fan I've purchased. My first one is still working perfectly but I never want to be without one and may use this second one when I travel.  I live in a rental suite that is chilly in Spring and Fall. Despite how benign this fan looks it produces a significant amount of heat.  I only start the day running this heater on the 1000 Watt (medium) setting and then turn down to low for the remainder of the day. It heats my open floor plan living room and dining room exceptionally well without driving up the electrical bill. Cheaper than running the furnace or my natural gas fireplace (altho come winter we use that in conjunction with the heater fan).  Bear in mind this is the most reliable model. Other models of heater fans by Vornado do not have the longevity of this one yet still cost as much or more. Read the reviews and choose this model for great value."", ""This little room heater is outstanding. I bought it for my daughter's bedroom is she's on the second floor and as we heat with wood sometimes your room cools down below normal during the winter. This little heater keeps her room nice and toasty I would recommend it"", 'Heats the bedroom up quickly. Like the thermostat settings to keep room at even temp.', 'Compact size  heats a room in no time at all   I love it', 'Compact size', 'Quiet efficient small size unit=Love it', 'Vornado heaters are the only ones that I use, as they are dependable, quiet, and safe!  This one is the quietest one I have ever had and, like all Vornado heaters, warms my bedroom in about 2 minutes.

Am barely ever home and have someone living below me (I scavenge their heat).Oscillator is nice.  Set on something solid and elevated maybe a foot (table etc).  I always unplug it when not in use or leaving the apt.  Use a heavy duty extention cord that is not too long or else the cord may heat up.

Quickly generates heat and warms a small room very well.  Thermostat allows heater to cycle on and off as needed to maintain the constant temperature needed for a greenhouse. Oscillating multiple temperature ranges are great features.', ""At first this heater smelled.  Once you get past that its great.  I've used Lasko products for years.  Its reliable and durable,  You get  a lot of features at an  affordable price.."", ""The best little heater. Throws alot of heat out. Warmed up the livingroom, dining area and kitchen to a nice warm comfortable temperature (couldn't believe it). It's very quiet, light weight, easy to set up and operate .. best part it's cool to touch! My little family is very happy with this heater. Will invest in another"", 'I bought this heater to replace a much larger, older quartz heater I used for the bathroom.  It is compact, has a nice design and provides a lot of heat quickly.  It is perfect for small rooms such as a bathroom.  No need to heat the whole house just to raise the warmth level in a single room when you can use a small room sized space heater like this Lasko Tower Heater.  The rotating feature is great for larger bathrooms; moves the heat around.   It was reasonably priced and arrived quickly.', 'I was using that brand that starts w/ a V. But they dont seem to last long. This one I noticed the temp was warmer then the other one, I like it. Keeps rooms toasty.', 'This small  heater heats the entire den! Very happy with it. I like the oscillating feature too. ', ""I finally caved this winter and purchased a heater to keep warm while I work from home. It's been amazing so far!

Cozy Products Electric Foot Rest Black Heat Controls Adjustable Angle 17.5 in. W,58.47,30-day returns,"[""First, a Toasty Toes draws 105 watts (not 90) and is warranted for ONLY 6 MONTHS (not 1 year).OK, so the minimal warranty, particularly on this basic an item, suggests that you're probably not getting a first class product, and its shoddy factory packaging which makes you look twice to make sure you haven't gotten open-box merchandise - The tape doesn't even stick to the cardboard! - confirms it.I called the company and was told that my Toasty Toes should get to 120º on its low heat setting and 140º on high.Nope!!! I've had two of them: the first one didn't get much past 100º...went back, and the second one got to 120º, but no higher...also went back. (The high heat option may work only when the unit is vertical, but I obviously haven't been able to find out.)As far as I can tell, they're using an unique design/cute name combo as an excuse to charge WAAAY TOO MUCH MONEY for an INFERIOR PRODUCT! :(My observations about my Toasty Toes insofar as it worked: I was hoping it would compensate for a cold floor draft, but I found that in its horizontal position it warmed the bottoms of my feet while leaving the tops cold, which left them pretty uncomfortable...not at all what I had hoped for.And in its vertical position it was inadequate on its low heat setting, and I'm not about to buy a third one (Softball rules: two strikes, and you're out!) in the hope that it may actually work both as it's supposed to and as I'd like.Looks like it's back to my ancient, reliable 600 watt radiant jobby, and damn the electricity bills, full comfort ahead! :)"", 'I read previous reviews of the earlier model of this item saying it did not get warm enough to feel through your shoes. (It worked OK with socks or bare feet).  That is why I bought the newer model having 104 Watts. (The box design is different than the older model.)  It does keep your feet warm even with shoes on.  (It takes a few minutes to warm up.)  It is sturdy, has two heat settings, and can be used in three positions.  (The two different pairs of legs fold out from the bottom.)  It does everything it is supposed to do.  I can not want more than that.  It has a six month warranty.', 'Actually keeps your feet warm.  I do a lot of computer work and my feet get sooooooo cold.  When your feet are warm, the rest of you stays warm.  Best with slippers.   tested with killawat tester.  97 watts at medium, 195 watts at high.  to stay warm for less than a hundred watts is a miracle.   I use as medium and have to take feet off periodically to cool down.  This is so wonderful. Thanks Cozy Products.', ""The product is sturdy and works well.

"Lasko 755320 Ceramic Space Tower Heater, 8.5″L x 7.25″W x 23″H, Silver",60.0, ,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit.

Handle Thermostat Plastic Black,59.99,30-day returns,"[""This a very cost effective space heater to warm any area during a chilly winter, or - as we had during the early part of the Wisconsin spring - a slightly nippy start to spring. It works to warm a bedroom, normal sized living room (unsure of those with an open plan large setting), or a small area of a basement that you are working in. It has three settings, and has tip-over &amp; overheat protection. I like this product an awful lot, and thus I'll give it 4.5 stars. It does NOT have a remote, but I bought a separate one for that purpose. I am taking a half of a star off because EVEN though it does have tip over protection (meaning it shuts off in that case), it is slightly more easy to tip over than I thought it was. So if you have pets, it might NOT be the BEST idea to use it when they are out playing - NOT so much for safety sake, but to prevent your fur baby from getting injured stepping on it."", 'Works very well and set up takes only a few minutes...', ""This will be my last one.

Presto HeatDish Plus Footlight Parabolic Electrical Heater 0791206,59.99,30-day returns,"['Our furnace broke and we used this heater for 5 days.  It is awesome.  It gives off lots of warm heat and we were able to make it through the Michigan 30 degree days just fine.  The light feature is great and a buzzer goes off if it is tipped over in any way! We had 3 ceramic heaters going before getting this one and The Presto HeatDish put out the heat of 3 ceramic ones!  I would highly recommend this heater especially if you are worried about safety.', ""This is the only type and brand of portable heater I use anymore. It will warm your bones better than anything else on the market.  I have tried them all. If it breaks which it hasn't, I would simply go and buy another one just like it."", 'I bought this at Costco 6 years ago. We used it lightly off and on. It worked great until one day I heard a pop and it died. I searched online for tips to fix, but it seems when it dies, it dies. It did work well though. It\'s very quiet and the area it\'s pointed at gets very hot. ""Low"" is often enough. (Tip: put a humidifier on as well--set apart of course--and the room will get/stay toasty.) Based on reviews, I apparently got a good run out of mine. Most lasted only 3 years. While I loathe throw away products, I may have to risk buying another one if I don\'t find anything as quiet and heat producing.', ""I have a very spacious living room, and this heater will heat up the entire bedroom very quickly and it is extremely quite. I really loved it. This heater doesn't take any space, it is easy to move it around anytime to anywhere. If it falls over somehow, it alerts you by noise. Very good protection. This heater Saves electricity bills too! If you set it at the temp. you would like to. The heater auto detects the room temp and shut down itself and will turn back on when the temp drops. Best heater ever used."", 'This is our 3rd parabolic heater purchased, the other 2 lasted about 10 years! Great for heating a small area, puts out a lot of heat. Hope this one lasts as long as the other two.', 'Good brand used but on very good shape', ""Iam more thank pleased. I was hoping to have the heater on in the room where we sleep and by doing so cut down on the thermostat coming on as the whole room feels comfortable .I have no idea about the electric it uses sine I haven't gotten an eletric bill yet, But it has to be a lot less than the one thousand dollar bill I got for heating last month. I am very pleased thanks Richie"", 'I love my presto HeatDish Plus, it heats up fast and reallywarms the space around it wonderfully. I own two now and usethem every day in the winter. Saves on gas for my furnace. Itake it with me when I drive to my childrens homes, so I am always comfortable.', 'but it still keeps you warm and i still would recommend it.', 'It will not regulate heat.  buzzer comes on and only way to stop buzzer is unplug unit from wall socket.']",,,,,,,,,Ceramic,,,Electric,,,,,"White, Black",,,,,,3,,,,Presto,,Dial,,,,,120 V,7912,0075741079127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The only reason I did not give it a 5 was because there is no visible temperature display so it takes a little longer to figure out where the setting should be.', ""This Heater works well, but there are a few 'clunky' things about it:- The extension chord comes from the front of the heater.  This may be a safety thing - maybe?   It is inconvenient having the chord in the front- Also, the 'timer' is manual, very clunky and directly from the 1970's.   Wasn't expecting digital, but something more advanced than this.  Also, if the unit gets unplugged (which I try to do for safety reasons when not in use), the timer does not run and needs to be reset......bummer.Overall, it is a nice unit, does what it is supposed to do!"", 'Compact and easy to use.

Even though the appearance of the current model is similar to the previous unit....it is an impressively improved design with new safety features...lights up very quickly and has an improved selector knob for the 3 different heat settings...', 'As far as the propane heater there are many choices but I be owned this same model unit not including new one I just purchased over 6 years and it HSS given me no problems for my outside heating needs. Now I live in az but we get some cold nights here and even have used indoors in larger part of house its not recommended since carbon monoxide poising can be a real threat. I reccomend thus product if your looking for good value and a trusted name.', 'This is the second one I have ordered. These work great and are easy to use. I highly recommend these to anyone who needs instant heat.', ""This is a great product! Well made with quality in mind. I especially like the tipover shutoff feature as it relates to safety. This my second unit and they're durible and made to last. I highly recommend.Mike in Tucson"", 'Mr. Heater is the only way to go if you need a propane tank heater.  I bought two Harbor Freight heaters and had to return both of them because they either wouldn’t light or stay lit.  Mr. Heater installed easily, came with very simple instructions and started the first time.  Plus it’s very quiet!  I would highly recommend Mr. Heater and eBay easily had the best price.', ""Bought this basically as heat for the garage in case the power goes out, so my water lines don't freeze. I have used the heater a dozen times just testing it, while I messed around in the garage. Works exactly as the description said it would. No problems or issues as of now. Easy to install on the tank. Easy to light."", ""we use ours on a daily basis, and they typically fail within one year to 15 months. one of the safeties will malfunction, and the unit will either not produce any gas or will not stay lit. had to put a hose clamp around the startup plunger just to have heat, that brought it's useful life to almost 2 years. my mechanic has one that is maybe 10 years old that still works...it has no safeties. might as well buy the cheaper chinese ones and save money."", 'THIS IS A SAFETY IMPROVED UPGRADE OF THE ORIGINAL MR.

COMBUSTION IS NEAR COMPLETE FOR RARELY A WHIFF OF GAS.  ', 'This little heater works great, all week long using it in the evenings on low and only used 2.5 gal of propane. The only gripe would be the wire support bar thing is not the best design and the screw that holds it to the base of the heater is too short. For the price it is a good investment.', 'A small cook stove with a blue flame is good. This product is better. It has a lot of surface area and the flame can then burn hotter.

ISILER Space Heater 1500W Portable Indoor Heater Ceramic Space Heater Adjusta...,57.2,30-day returns,"['The iSiLER NPE-2 Electric Fan Heater is super compact, well made, and produces enough heat to make a noticeable difference in temperature for an entire room. The electric fan is quiet, and the unit is a tasteful yellow with gray front and rear grills, top handle, and supporting stand. Even though this heater was listed as a garage heater, I found it to be much more visually appealing than other heaters, having a bit of an industrial look, and I use it primarily in my bedroom. The iSiLER NPE-2 is extremely lightweight and can be easily moved from room to room as needed. The instructions for use are super simple, easy to follow, and intuitive. The unit has an ON/OFF button, thermostat control dial, and a power indicator light. It also has a built-in safety feature, turning itself off if the unit overheats. I have not had this issue, but it does give me peace of mind to know that it has this safety feature. The iSiLER NPE-2 Electric Fan Heater is reasonably priced, and I find it produces heat comparable to that of a much larger space heater. It also comes with a very generous 2 year warranty. I have been extremely pleased with this purchase.', ""It's a sturdy little electric thermostat-controlled heating element, with electric fan and a nice handle.  Unfortunately, the unit I received does not cycle the fan with the heating element.  The fan is constantly on when the power switch is in the ON position.  For anti-freezing low level supplemental heat in my crawl-space this is less than ideal.  If I needed a cooling fan in summer as well as a personal heater for limited sessions, it would work well.  But it's poorly designed to be an area supplemental heater to keep water pipes from freezing.  The wasted electricity and wear on the fan would be a problem."", 'You can not buy a better compact heater for the money. Light weight, compact, and really quite.... Really!!

Comfort Zone Infrared Electric Heater 1500-Watt Thermostat Plastic Black,60.0,30-day returns,"[""This a very cost effective space heater to warm any area during a chilly winter, or - as we had during the early part of the Wisconsin spring - a slightly nippy start to spring. It works to warm a bedroom, normal sized living room (unsure of those with an open plan large setting), or a small area of a basement that you are working in. It has three settings, and has tip-over &amp; overheat protection. I like this product an awful lot, and thus I'll give it 4.5 stars. It does NOT have a remote, but I bought a separate one for that purpose. I am taking a half of a star off because EVEN though it does have tip over protection (meaning it shuts off in that case), it is slightly more easy to tip over than I thought it was.

1500W Ceramic Heater with Adjustable Thermostat,57.29, ,"['Been using it now for nearly 2 weeks; brutal Ohio winters make this a necessity.  It\'s compact, light and fits just about anywhere.  They do warn that it can discolor floors/carpets etc so I have it on top of a small waist-height cabinet with a piece of glass under it to protect the surface.  I\'m using it in a 12x12 office, and it is more than adequate to the task.  So far I\'ve used it on the first (lower power) setting at about a ""4"" heat setting (about 1/3 of max).  It puts out a tremendous amount of heat with a far reaching blower.  My only reservation is that it\'s a bit loud compared to my old heatwe (a trusty Bionaire I\'d had for about 12 years which finally gave up the ghost).   Can\'t comment on quality/longevity yet but for the money, it\'s a great buy and I recommend it.  As with any portable heating product, I would not run this when no one is in the room to monitor it. ', ""It serves my purpose very well.  My feet are perpetually cold, and these are perfect for that.  These units last a good 3 to 4 years before they start to get a little less efficient and effective. Eventually they do stop working.  Brand new, these are great heaters.  Very quiet heating unit.  Fan isn't overly loud and puts out a good amount of heat at the low setting.  I rarely use it at the high setting until it starts getting older.  I have gone thru 2 of these units in a 10 to 11 year period.  My 2nd one (about 5 years old) is starting to waiver.  I'd suggest getting some compressed air and blowing out the dust that collects at the intake on the rear of the unit to make it last longer.  The one thing I wish it had was a safety sensor that automatically turns it off if it gets tipped over. It does NOT have any safety feature so be mindful about leaving it on!"", 'I bought a pair of these just in case I experienced a furnace problem and needed some heat while getting it repaired or perhaps wanted to heat the garage a bit while working there.  They seem well built, run very quietly and would likely produce 1500 watts at 120 volts (I got 1440 at 117.7 volts).  The lower setting produced about 930 watts at 119 volts.  The cord is 16 AWG with 105C rating, which appears adequately sized.  Although I did not test them for very long, the heaters and fan did turn off when the temperature setting was reduced to a very low level.  My only qualm, for which I reduced a star,  is that there is no switch to turn them off if overturned.  I rotated the units in all directions, but they kept running.  So I would make sure that they are not used on a flammable surface or any possible source of overturning is excluded.  I did not test if the overheating reset would ever turn them off.', 'This heater did a nice job of heating my area at work.  I sit near an outside wall that is very cold some days.  This heater kept me toasty for about six hours then blew the circuit breaker at work.  This item could be improved with an internal resettable circuit breaker protruding from the rear so IT would blow instead of the one at work.  That would be more convenient instead of me being required to call an electrician at work to fix the work breaker.', 'Great little heater that puts out a lot of heat. I live in a converted space that has no central heating, so this little guy is my only source of heat and it does great. Keeps me toasty all night long at about 1/3 of maximum. My only caveat is that it has no tip-over protection. If the dog brushes against the back of it and knocks it over, it does not automatically shut off.', 'Bought this so we did not have to run the heater all night. This little heater works GREAT. Keeps are room at whatever temperature we set the knob at and heats up our master bedroom FAST. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because after we unplug it from the outlet, the actual plug is HOT. We had to switch to a power strip as we were afraid the heater might blow a fuse as it seems to use a lot of electricity to power.', 'For a small heater it does a really good job.  It is also excellent for small rooms.  The only perk is that the handle is too smallto get a good hold.  But overall great little heater, love the feature it turns on and off automatically by it self when needed!', ""Prior owner. This is the best small space heater. This warms an area very fast. It isn't heavy. The face does get warm. Please just be careful. I recv'd this very quickly. It is really a fair price. Very well built. The previous space heater is still working, about 7 years now. I was just tired of moving it around. It IS that good. Buy this heater. You won't regret this. Just be careful. Thank you!"", ""This little heater will run you out of a 500 sq ft room if left on high. It's no joke. Lasko is a decent brand, not high end but should last 2-3 years....or more but for for 20.00 what would you expect. Dials are easy and built in temperature regulator is a must. I love mine and think it's a great value. I once ran a lasko fan straight 24 hrs - 7 days a week for 2 years without any issue. It started to rust from the moisture in the area or it would probably still be running. Good purchase and I am very pleased."", ""I think a lot of space heaters between 20-40$ are all the similar, they all break or are just as good as broken by the end of the season. This space heater seems of much better quality, even the material seems of high quality, instead of plastic like most. I also like that it's small and wisper quite. I have no complaints. I got it for 20$ which was a fantastic deal but I would have paid 35$ or even more for a heater with this quality. My biggest pro is the size.

Lasko-1500W Ceramic Heater with Adjustable Thermostat,57.29,30-day returns,"['Been using it now for nearly 2 weeks; brutal Ohio winters make this a necessity.  It\'s compact, light and fits just about anywhere.  They do warn that it can discolor floors/carpets etc so I have it on top of a small waist-height cabinet with a piece of glass under it to protect the surface.  I\'m using it in a 12x12 office, and it is more than adequate to the task.  So far I\'ve used it on the first (lower power) setting at about a ""4"" heat setting (about 1/3 of max).  It puts out a tremendous amount of heat with a far reaching blower.  My only reservation is that it\'s a bit loud compared to my old heatwe (a trusty Bionaire I\'d had for about 12 years which finally gave up the ghost).   Can\'t comment on quality/longevity yet but for the money, it\'s a great buy and I recommend it.  As with any portable heating product, I would not run this when no one is in the room to monitor it. ', ""It serves my purpose very well.  My feet are perpetually cold, and these are perfect for that.  These units last a good 3 to 4 years before they start to get a little less efficient and effective. Eventually they do stop working.  Brand new, these are great heaters.  Very quiet heating unit.  Fan isn't overly loud and puts out a good amount of heat at the low setting.  I rarely use it at the high setting until it starts getting older.  I have gone thru 2 of these units in a 10 to 11 year period.  My 2nd one (about 5 years old) is starting to waiver.  I'd suggest getting some compressed air and blowing out the dust that collects at the intake on the rear of the unit to make it last longer.  The one thing I wish it had was a safety sensor that automatically turns it off if it gets tipped over. It does NOT have any safety feature so be mindful about leaving it on!"", 'I bought a pair of these just in case I experienced a furnace problem and needed some heat while getting it repaired or perhaps wanted to heat the garage a bit while working there.  They seem well built, run very quietly and would likely produce 1500 watts at 120 volts (I got 1440 at 117.7 volts).  The lower setting produced about 930 watts at 119 volts.  The cord is 16 AWG with 105C rating, which appears adequately sized.  Although I did not test them for very long, the heaters and fan did turn off when the temperature setting was reduced to a very low level.  My only qualm, for which I reduced a star,  is that there is no switch to turn them off if overturned.  I rotated the units in all directions, but they kept running.  So I would make sure that they are not used on a flammable surface or any possible source of overturning is excluded.  I did not test if the overheating reset would ever turn them off.', 'This heater did a nice job of heating my area at work.  I sit near an outside wall that is very cold some days.  This heater kept me toasty for about six hours then blew the circuit breaker at work.  This item could be improved with an internal resettable circuit breaker protruding from the rear so IT would blow instead of the one at work.  That would be more convenient instead of me being required to call an electrician at work to fix the work breaker.', 'Great little heater that puts out a lot of heat. I live in a converted space that has no central heating, so this little guy is my only source of heat and it does great. Keeps me toasty all night long at about 1/3 of maximum. My only caveat is that it has no tip-over protection. If the dog brushes against the back of it and knocks it over, it does not automatically shut off.', 'Bought this so we did not have to run the heater all night. This little heater works GREAT.
