Dr. Heater 240 Volt 5600 Watt Garage Workshop Portable Industrial Space Heater,75.99,130 sold,"['This does all I need for taking the chill off our two bay shop at ""Coop\'s Miata"" in Maple Valley Washington.It is quiet and efficient. The only negative thing is the short chord and the odd plug. I had to make a 20 ft extension chord with adaptation for my shop 240 service. Ended up changing the plug on the heater chord as well.  Couldn\'t find a chord female plug for this style. Worked out that I ended up using the same mail plug I use for my Tig. Word of caution: use the right gauge wire and keep it less than 25 feet.', ""I purchased this heater in 01/2013 to replace a propane bottle heater.  It is much safer than propane and the fan circulates the heat.  I have been extremely happy with this heater as it has worked great to heat my insulated garage/shop during the cold N. IL winters.  I gave it four stars due to the fact that the fan motor uses sleeve bearings and not ball so any dirt that accumulates on the blades causes vibration and wear on the bearings.  It is important to keep the fan blades clean to reduce wear and extend the life.  I suggest cleaning every season.  I just completed cleaning blades and fan bearings and the heater works like new again.  Very easy to do with just a few screws to remove cover and fan  Don't get me wrong this is a great heater for the price.  I will look into the model 966 which has a heavier duty fan when this wears out. "", ""Don't get me wrong they put out heat... But not like people brag about on them... If your in a two bay garage it will take the chill out in roughly in a hour with the door closed. Lots of 220 power used in an hr. If you put it beside you when working on a car in the open it cycles off and on the heating element a lot as if room temperature has been reached. Cold hot cold hot.... Wasn't worth adding a 220 outlet. Says industrial use only on the warning label on top, exactly what industry would have been nice to know... Because  commercial mechanic work does not qualify...."", ""I spent almost a couple hours reading and researching several heaters to help for winter work in the garage. My final decision in this unit was the power of the fan. It was much stronger BLOWER MOTOR than many others. It is built tough/rugged like (old school box style construction). I figured with the amount of electricity this draws and the fan strength, I'd get e bit more bang for the buck. I was wrong... I've seen more impressive 110 models in the past over this. Unfortunate results for the amount of electricity you pour out. It also has a horrible cool draft off one corner. How does a heater blow a cool breeze with the hot? (Maybe the blower is to strong for the heating element?) Even standing in front of this unit, It was not impressive on the heat being generated. If you don't care about electricity and need to blow a little bit of heat a distance then I would suggest this unit for you.... everyone else, I suggest researching other units."", 'When I received this heater the box was in perfect shape, no signs of damage, but when I opened it and pulled the heater out the fan was laying in the bottom not attached to the bracket inside. Pulled the cover off and screws totally missing, fan and inside of heater looked as if it had been running with the fan hitting inside of housing. Screws not inside the heater nor in the box. Got the fan straightened out and bought screws from hardware store, remounted fan and turned the heater on. It started working and seemed to be okay. The heater coil is not suppose to turn red while it is running however on day 2 the coil is starting to turn red while heating so the coil is not going to last very long before it shorts out. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time to work on it to get it running. If I had just wanted a fan I could have bought several fans from Walmart for what this cost.', ""Using on construction site.  Keeps 3 bedroom townhouses at 70 degrees.Bought 15 open box and 1 new.  Could not tell the difference.  One heater had a loose fan bracket.Tightened screws and it was good.  Another heater had a fan that rattled. Had some play on the drive shaft.  Added a washer and it was good as new.  Can't complain because they were 1/2 the price of new ones.  Wish they had a different plug.  A dryer or range end would be better."", 'This is to backup the same model in use for a couple years, they work very well. Only complaint is new one has a high pitched fan motor whine when the unit is not under a heat load with just the fan running.  ', 'An excellent buy. Good strong heat for  an old 20 x 20 wood garage with a high peak ceiling, and no insulation in very cold weather. Had to change the 30 amp 220v electrical receptacle, but that was it. Leave it on the floor, and it will do a good job.', 'Dr Infrared heater will work in a 600 foot building if it is insulated and dry walled temp 40F outdoors will stay 70-75 indoors easy I have a Gas heater , and use the Dr heater with it when it is 20 outdoors and keep it 70 indoors the Dr heat will turn on and off my gas keeps going . the last to days I left the gas go all night when I get to the Shop I turn dr heat on and turn the gas off from 7am to 5 pm the temp never got under 75 , it was 32 outdoors and got to 48 outdoors and I can turn Dr heater up or down to regulate the shop temp . Only had Dr heater 10 days . Its been a lot of help so far .', ""Good heater at a good price.  Bought this one to replace the same heater I've had for a couple of years.  Only complaint I have is that this heater does not come with a parts list for ordering replacement parts.  My previous heater had the control (rheostat?) go bad, and I couldn't find what part I needed to replace it.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr. Heater MH9BX 9000 BTU Propane Portable Buddy Heater - FREE Shipping,78.99, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

LifeSmart 3 Element 1500W Quartz Infrared Electric Portable Room Space Heater,79.99,137 sold,"[""Bought this heater for our main bathroom which isn't used all that often, although when we had our master bathroom remodeled it's all we used. It performs flawlessly. Easy to use and we really enjoy the wireless remote, this convenient feature makes it so easy to regulate, and one of the nicest features of this heater is it heats up very quickly. The digital read outs are also easy to see. And when my spouse uses the controls manually, she has no problems, she also feels it was easy to use and regulate controls. We kept it low until we actually had to use it, and I'm on a walker, so my spouse would go ahead of me, when our master bathroom was being remodeled and turn the heat up a little for my comfort! Now that's priceless! She's an angel too! There's no down-side to owning this heater. It's small enough to be out of the way, and powerful enough to heat like a much bigger heater. It has wheels hidden underneath the carriage, moves in any direction with ease. This is a good all around heater. We have this one and a larger one we use in our master bedroom, and we've owned them for over six months and they both work very nice. And we've notice our heat bill went down almost thirty dollars one month, and we believe these heaters AND having the central house heat turned down lower is the reason. This is in our opinion an all around nice and economical product."", ""I bought this to heat a good sized bedroom. I had an edenpure which worked good but only lasted 2 years. This unit heats my bedroom to 70 no problem. The fan is slightly loud but tolerable. The buttons make a loud beep when pressed so not great if u want to change temp in the middle of the night when the wife is sleeping. It has made little effect on the electric bill. I can't speak to how long it will last bc we have only had it around 3 months but for its compact size it works great and a quarter of the price of the Eden pure"", 'It is winter in Colorado. I have to clean the double car garage, since we are moving.This little heater is great. It heats about an 8 ft area, fighting against the 20 degree cold. It warms enough space for me to pack up the workbench and to move it onto the shelving area.My only complaint is the cord is not very long, I had to dig out the extension cord, then remember not to trip over the extension cord!  I did not notice a significant added cost to my electric bill when I was using it.', 'I purchased the heater because it put out air close to the floor as opposed to similar heaters that push air toward the ceiling.  It warms my living room well on the efficiency setting.  I have not been able to actually determined the electricity usage, but with three heat levels it can be regulated.  It is also small and easy to move to any area where extra heat is needed.  I would recommend this product for the price and quality in this heater.  The remote allows you to change the temperature or turn off the heater from the comfort of your chair and with the heat coming out at floor level, the entire room heats more efficiently.', 'I purchased this to use in our downstairs bathroom to keep my wife and I warm on those cold mornings. It works great. We have always used some kind of space heater but never been able to stay warm as we like it. The LifeSmart heater is great!', 'Nice spot heater for exceptionally cold days here in New England. Well-designed and manufactured. Requires no maintenance. Easy to use remote or front panel controls. Less conspicuous, smaller case than clunky wood-covered heaters, but same performance. Heavy duty industrial gauge cord barely gets warm, while cords on cheaper heaters get uncomfortably hot, even melting. Not the quietest heater, but unit pushes a lot of warm air around. This heater would be great for quickly taking the chill out of a bathroom. Highly recommended.', 'This heater really works well to keep the chill out of our living room. We Baby sit two grandkids several times a week and this heater is safe for them to be around. My only complaint is the fan is a little noisey. But all in all a great little heater. I also do wood working in my garage and purchased a second heater to use in there. Works great. Nice to be warm while working there instead of freezing cold.', ""I was disapointed when I recieved the heater. Very small for the claims. I got the oportunity when our temp dropped to below freezing. My home is only 1000 sq ft. It heated 1/2 of our basement in maybe 10 min to the point that I had to turn it down wearing a t shirt. This isn't my first heated. I have an Eden Pure that has been great until the thermostadt went out after several years service. This one is very small next to the Eden Pure but I think it keeps up with it. I recommend it and would actually like to have a larger one of my garage."", 'Seems to be a top quality heater and very well built. All functions appear to be top notch. I purchased this heater to replace the gas furnace in my RV, and it seems like it will preform as a great replacement. It puts out a tremendous amount of heat, and seems to be very safe. The shell stays cool to the touch.

I would not recommend it for ANY other application or anything for that matter!  Forget about it.', ""This doesn't put out fabulous amounts of heat.  It does work to keep my feet warm, but the effect is extremely subtle.  One minor niggle is that the power switch is several feet down the power cord from the unit.  It would be more convenient if the power switch was ON the unit.  I would buy this unit again."", 'I bought this vertical leg heater for my wife who spends a lot of time on a laptop. It is positioned under a bench type seat and heats from behind her legs. This removes the chill from her legs and feet quickly. This radiant heat is much better and safer than a space heater in my opinion.', 'I put one between an outside wall and my home-made desk, which is open-sided. After it warmed up the difference was noticeable. The space under the desk gets quite cozy, especially on the side that used to be coldest.. This is much better than using a free-standing heater that can be kicked over.', 'it was junk , had to return it.', ""They barely warm up.

1500-Watt Portable Heater Oscillating Electric Warm Room Energy Saver Comfort,78.73,30-day returns,"[""This is the 3rd purchase of the same heater.  1st for one of my sons, 2nd for my boss and 3rd to replace a noisy old heater at my desk.  Not only does it produce heat well but it is also is aesthetically pleasing in an office setting.  Those points combined with many levels of heat to chose from and a remote control feature to boot...perfection!!  Three purchases and each for less than $60...it's a winner!!"", ""The reason I wanted this heater was I needed supplemental heat to my daughters room which is the furthest from the central heating system and surrounded by three ouside walls. Have been using a small oscillating ceramic heater for a couple years, but not thermostat controlled. Love the Lasko, cause it heats room evenly and quickly! Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature. If you can run it on High which draws 12-14 Amps then it will work well for you! Why they disable temperature controlled operation in Low mode is baffling to me! ', 'This heater is a pretty good source of additional warmth where you need it. You may get tired of people asking you what it is though... It will not heat an entire home, but in my 22x28 living room, it does a pretty good job warming things up. Quiet and pretty. The remote works great, (even though it is almost as weird of a shape as the heater).', ""The heater is very dependable , I've had one for 1 year now. I have purchased two additional for other rooms. These units do the job of heating rooms well. They're very fashionable convenient."", 'first off gotta say this heater warms a medium size room very fast..and very wellalso easy to operate. only problem is the heater is very noise. looked over the reviewspeople said very quit very little sound NOT true loud fan and when oscillating is onmakes a verroom verroom sound [ best way to describe it]  gonna need to get out theear plugs gave it four stars for its heating', ""This little heater is great for taking the chill out of the air. My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me. (Don't rely on this heater being your main source of heat but rather as a supplement)."", ""expertbenefitsI haven't had it too long but it fits my purpose. I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable. It kind of cute too!"", 'I like the design of the heater very much and it certainly has enough output to heat what I intended it for.  I also like the features that it offers.  The only thing that I wish it did and it does not do is turn back on when the thermostat goes below what it is set at as well as turn off when it reaches the temperature.  All in all though, it is a good value and I have been pleased with it.', ""Granted it's not more than 1000 square feet, but this pretty little heater sits in the center of my house and keeps the whole house comfortable.  It has a thermostat,  (only 5 degree increments) but still will save me money by shutting off when the room is warm enough.  It has a convenient remote control.

Lasko 751320 Ceramic Tower Space Heater with Remote Control,76.0, ,"['I giving it 4 stars because when I started it for the first time.. It gave weird smell for about an hour or so. After that it has been working excellent. Its very easy to setup. Nothing much needed, just plug and start. It comes with a remote control using which we can control the temperature and speed.

It can warm up the room quickly with different temperature setup2. It has the auto feature where it goes to sleep mode when the temperature in room reaches the set value and restarts whenever it goes lower beyond the set value3. It can oscillate like a tower fan and distribute the heat across the room4. Its light weightCons:1. It has the remote but during night you cant see the temperature that we have set on this humidifier. Having a display in the remote or on the humidifier itself', ""This is the second one I've purchased. The heater itself is a good value, and the oscillating feature, and remote control are an added bonus. Used my first purchase in my camper (2 years and still going strong). This one's for our home's enclosed porch."", ""I think the heater works well, But when you have a power outage you have to reset it to keep area warm. The controls don't allow it to pick up where, hear left off trying to heat area.   So that make this heater, not reliable for keeping kids warm, pets,  plants.  In the areas I have lived would even help prevent frozen water lines.  I makes heater like this only good for you if, your attending it.  If this heat had manual controls it would be better. or had a program to reboot and maintain a pre-set temp,  by factory or,  by the user.  Myself I like a electric  heater that works  as lone as I have power.  And  starts back up after a power outage.  Have a great day."", ""This heater doesn't oscillate on all the temperatures.

Pelonis 1500W - II Portable Ceramic Disc Furnace Heater,75.0, ,"[""First impression is: it's HEAVY. I like heavy. 90% of the space heaters on the market are flimsy units with cheap thermostats that burn out in a year because they're constantly kicking on &amp; off.

Best for rooms where you want to maintain a constant temperature, but it doesn't mind being cranked up either.If you have to shut it off, I recommend switching to FAN for a few minutes as a cool-down cycle.I got my first Pelonis brand-new in the box for $5 at a yard sale.

Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.  Am not able to determine if I am saving money on this product or not running it continuously versus other types of heating methods.

It doesn't use a lot of electricity and works great!"", 'I would not recommend this product for use in a coop. I bought it to use in a 4\'x6\'x3\' coop and it raised the inside temperature by approximately 10 degrees... not very helpful when the outside temperature averages 10 degrees or less all winter. I tried it in the house first and the temperature sticker (heat sensor) glowed after a few minutes. Once I put it outside, the sticker hasn\'t glowed at all and the chicken\'s water has frozen twice - despite being within inches of the heater. I\'m sure it would be fine for indoor brooding, or even in warmer climates, but if you live ""up north"" where winters are long &amp; cold I would definitely look into something which produces significantly more heat.', ""Great for a small indoor space with not a lot of movement of the air.

Comfort Zone CZ600 White Convection Space Heater 1500W with Digital Thermostat,76.61,30-day returns,"['The heater is quiet and produces a good amount of heat.  We have two of them.  One in our bedroom to supplement night time heating while the rest of the house is set at a cooler temperature (room about 400 sq. ft.)  The other we use in a small mountain condo to supplement the regular heater when temperatures are very cold outside (~650 sq. ft.)  In both cases, the Comfort Zone heater supplies quiet heat that keeps us warm.   ', ""Wanted a heater that was absolutely quiet for use in a meditation room. Have used this one for a couple years now and it is perfect. Multiple heat settings. Low heat is just right for the small (10'x12') room it is in. A digital thermostat would be nice, but the analog dial built-in t-stat built-in is very repeatable. We just make a little mark where to set it for comfort.

NEW Lasko 5397 Convection Heater 30in Digital Crmc Pdstl,76.98, ,"[""I've had several Lasko heaters, but especially like the pedestal ones.  I currently have one very similar which is 10 years old &amp; still going after heavy use.  It did make a strange noise recently &amp; decided to buy another one just in case it might be wearing out.  However, haven't heard the noise again.  This is an updated model of my old one."", ""Overall this is a good little heater. It has a small footprint and it will warm a small-medium size room in about 15-20 minutes.  The ability of the unit to oscillate and the fact that it has remote control makes this about as convenient as it gets. Lots of good features and controls. Only caution is to make sure that you don't have two of these units plug into outlets that are on the same breaker.  If you do the breaker has to be at least 20amps. Anything less will trip the breaker on high draw when the heaters are warming the room. This is definitely more efficient than powering up to central heater for the whole house."", 'My last lasko heater lasted 7 years and was used a lot. I love the design of the new one. Hopefully it lasts as long as my first one. This one is quieter with a remote👍', 'This works well in heating our family room.  Saves heating the whole house.  I especially like remote control and ability to adjust to different temps.

RoadPro RPSL-681 12V Direct Hook-Up Ceramic Heater/Fan with Swivel Base & wit...,77.15,30-day returns,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product?

MR. HEATER Mr. Heater Buddy LP Fuel Filter F273699 Pack of 6,76.26,30-day returns,"['This is the correct filter for using a hose with your Mr Heater. It filters oils that can come from the hose and any trash that might have found its way into hose. Arrived as advertised and ready to go.', ""Those little 1 lb. cylinders are great but if you want to heat for longer than a couple hours you'll find buying a 20 lb. propane tank, a long supply hose and a regulator a must.  My old Mr. Buddys used to work without a regulator but the new one I got wouldn't even light the pilot light without the regulator.  At any rate, I'm sitting warm and Mr. Buddy is working.  Do yourself a favor - even if you don't regularly use a big tank with Mr Buddy having the regulator and hose will give you peace of mind knowing should you need heat for a longer time you've got everything you need to stay warm.  It turns your propane heater from something you can use occasionally to knock the chill off into a heater you can depend on in an emergency."", 'Fuel filter kit matched up with my Mr. Heater without any issues. Works great.', ""I wish it weren't necessary to purchase these filters, because they are expensive and don't last particularly long.  However, they are absolutely necessary.  I learned the hard way with my first Mr. Buddy, which I ran with standard unfiltered propane canisters, which the Mr. Buddy is designed for.  In a season, the heater was hopelessly clogged and useless.  These filters will prevent that from happening.  The problem, unfortunately, is that, with the filters installed, standard canisters don't fit into the heater compartments that are designed to hold them.  The central promise of the Mr. Buddy—portability—is thus dead on arrival."", 'An excellent add-on to a Mr. Heater. Will keep the tiny orifice open and clear, if you are using a 20lbs propane tank. ', ""Have had a Big Buddy for several years as my space heater in the winter. Have always had this filter installed for protection. The filters aren't cheap, but you must have them as a blockage and the cleaning process thereafter is a pain. That's the only reason they are a good value."", 'This product came very fast and it really improve my tent heat performance. Before, I had trouble with the heater. Was hard to start and very hard to keep pilot fire lit. After installing it the pilot heats up fast and stays lit. Nice product, I bought two of them. Both heaters run excellent.', ""The hose I ordered does not require the fuel filter.  My error.  I'm only keeping it in case I buy one that does to run 2 tanks.  Not really a decorater item, so that idea is out.  Into the spares locker on the boat. "", 'Works as needed for Mr heater Buddy heaters.I mistakenly used a generic extension hose from 20lb propane bottle to Buddy heater a few times before the heater stopped working from ""goo"" which came from hose.This filter is much needed for Buddy heaters,I even use it for portable BBQ\'s for same reason.I did learn if the hose from bottle is made by Mr Heater it is fine without filter,true or not I have not tried it yet,Mr Heater uses different materiel for their hoses', ""I used my heaters 2 or 3 times without filter, never again.

 Lasko Ceramic Pedestal Heater 29 Inch 1500 Watt Digital Remote Control,79.99, ,"[""I've had several Lasko heaters, but especially like the pedestal ones.  I currently have one very similar which is 10 years old &amp; still going after heavy use.  It did make a strange noise recently &amp; decided to buy another one just in case it might be wearing out.  However, haven't heard the noise again.  This is an updated model of my old one."", ""Overall this is a good little heater. It has a small footprint and it will warm a small-medium size room in about 15-20 minutes.  The ability of the unit to oscillate and the fact that it has remote control makes this about as convenient as it gets. Lots of good features and controls. Only caution is to make sure that you don't have two of these units plug into outlets that are on the same breaker.  If you do the breaker has to be at least 20amps. Anything less will trip the breaker on high draw when the heaters are warming the room. This is definitely more efficient than powering up to central heater for the whole house."", 'My last lasko heater lasted 7 years and was used a lot. I love the design of the new one. Hopefully it lasts as long as my first one. This one is quieter with a remote👍', 'This works well in heating our family room.  Saves heating the whole house.

Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,79.0, ,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

NEW VORNADO EHI-0020-01 VH2 VORTEX 3 SPEED ELECTRIC SPACE HEATER WHOLE 9918707,78.99,30-day returns,"[""I already own multiple Vornado products including a VH103 I purchased in 2011 that I'm still using to this day.What I liked the most is that it uses mechanical (not electronic) switches. You have 3 rocker switches with a main power switch, heat low/high setting and fan setting). You also have a dial to enable fan only mode (to use year round) or auto. You can use this with a remote or smart outlet (15A rating).What I don't like- somewhat hard to clean. In my experience, cleaning is not for the faint of heart. It is built exactly like the VH103 such that you have to unscrew the unit completely to separate the front and back, then I used a shopvac to blow out the dust from the heating coils and a cloth to wipe down the fan blade and clean out the grille. I've done this about every 3 years.Most critical difference between this VH2 and the older VH103:- When in heat mode, the fan in the VH2 will cycle on/off when in auto when the temperature is reached. In the VH103, the fan will continue running to maintain airflow and circulation- The temperature dial on the VH2 goes from 1-7 while the VH103 goes from approx 65 - 90 degrees. I found it much easier to dial in my setting when I could set it against a temperature. With the VH2, you need to figure out what dial setting works for you."", 'This heater warms up my room quickly and the thermostat feature works well to maintain desired temperature. Fan is a little noisy, but not horrible. I love that I can run the fan without heat to circulate air in my home especially when running an air purifier. Cream color fits well with my plaster walls. Auto-shutoff for tippage actually works! Would buy again, would recommend. ', ""Pros:- Fast and efficient with small rooms. This heats up a small room within 15 minutes on high (1500W) at setting 4. Once warm, it can be switched to low (750W) and turned down by 1 to maintain temperature.- Small. Doesn't take a lot of space and is easy to move around.Cons:- Noisy. Makes a notable but tolerable hum when operating.- Cannot set a temperature. Numbers are for adjusting the run time, but you must experiment. Set it too low and the room will cool faster than it gets heated.- Weak fan. Perfect for heating, but not for cooling a room during summer."", 'This is a great little portable heater for small spaces.I use it to heat a single room in the winter time vs heating up the wholehouse to warm up that room. Its relatively quiet and puts out a decent amountof heat vs several other portable heaters I tried out. I have only purchased them used due to the price of a new one buthave been quite pleased with its performance.', ""I purchased this heater to heat a bedroom but when I saw how much power it had, I used it to heat my whole loft. I am surprised that such a little unit could produce so much heat and I don't even have it on high. I'm very satisfied with this little heater and would definitely recommend it for small to large being needs."", 'I have tried a number of electric heaters to warm my finished basement.  Most of them do not last long or do not distribute the heat evenly.  So far this heater does a nice job and takes up very little room.  Time will tell if it can do the job over a long period, but so far so good.', ""I've been using this heater to keep my enclosed porch warm, we only have storm windows (ten of them) and they are not air tight as good windows would be.  This heater kept the porch around 58 degrees when the overnight temperature got down to twenty seven on a stormy windy night.  The heat is comfortable and even and the heater runs very quiet and is a stable unit.  I've been running it with the setting about half and on low almost continuously except if it warms up outside in the daytime then I turn it off.  The housing of the unit is also staying cool and I have cats on the porch who seem very happy with it and that's good enough for me.  However, haven't received my latest electric bill since I've been using it and I do expect it to go up, I'm just hoping it won't be too much."", 'A heater with a fan, what an idea ! ! !  Vornado makes terrific fan. Most space heaters make heat and if you sit over it you can get some heat from it. With the fan in this heater, this Whole Room Heater can raise the comfort level in a room by 20 degrees through out the room. Get it, you will LOVE it ! ! !', 'This heater definitely works better than other portable heaters I’ve used, but it smells like it’s burning. That said, it is cool to the touch, so it seems safe enough, just stinks. It warms my room about 5 degrees more than other space heaters I’ve tried, and I’ve tried several.', 'Love it! Arrived promptly, is like new. We have used these heaters before and they are great.  Also can be used as fan only to move cool air. Using it in RV right now.  Sure saves a lot of propane as supplement to central heat unit.  Great seller!  We loaned one of these to a neighbor in an RV park at Grand Canyon a few years ago, whose heating system went out in a remote area.  They said it saved their lives.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Lasko 5812 Automatic Airflow Heater, 14?L x 6?W x 11.5?H, Silver Gray",78.46,30-day returns,"[""With the cold grip of a long winter making the house too chilly to stay comfortable, I looked for some space heaters to help out the central A/C system. After checking out just about all of the available products on the market, I spotted the Lasko 5812 heater on Ebay- the ONLY one I could find that directs warm air into the room from the bottom of the unit at floor level.

Have one in my room, and the bathroom, which I let my brother hold for his room, so gonna get another for the bathroom, and one for the kitchen, because we're rarely in the living room. We're able to turn the gas hear off for the entire winter, and use it only to cook and wash clothes, with agas bill of less than $40 a month. The electric is a little higher than normal due to the heater, but nowherenear what utilities would normally cost with the gas included. So yes, this heater does actually save you a lot of money in other areas. And it's extremely sturdy, with a tip over mechanism that works even if the heater is slightly tilted.  Highly recommend.

NEW Dr Infrared Heater DR-978 Infrared Space Heater Hybrid Black,75.0, ,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit. Doesn't even look like a heater, more like a piece of furniture or a speaker for a high end stereo system."", 'I hen purchase several brands of infrared heaters .   Dr. Heater is built solid .  Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.

 Portable Propane Heater 3800 BTU Small Heater Clean Burning Safe Quiet Odor,79.99, ,"['Even though it cost almost 1 1/2 One Pound Coleman tanks from 9pm to 5am,  it’s great. Keeps my whole RV toasty warm. I would recommend by a large propane tank to refill the 1 pound tanks. Much cheaper. But I’ve not been cold once. The safety feature of turning off it it tilts is great. Only problem I have found is the bottom piece you place on propane tank does not secure properly and falls off when lifted off the ground to move the heater. ', 'This little buddy heater is a fine unit for use in an ice fishing shelter or flip over sled / tent. It is the right size and has a small footprint.The angle of the head heating element is perfect for warming wet hands and can be easily aimed to direct the heater output.The only down side is that it can be difficult to light in even the slightest breeze.', ""This is just the right amount of heat and size  for my needs compared to the regular Mr. Heater but does not hold up to heavy use. Have had a regular size that I use in an icefishing house that has years of use on it. The little buddies I've had are lucky to make an ice season before getting had to light and the just quitting. Love the little buddies while they work but the regular Mr buddy is a much better long term value."", 'I bought this to heat my ice fishing hut and only used it a handful of times. Looks like it’s made pretty durable, the igniter works good, like the carry handle, the metal shield cools down pretty quick if you want to move spots. The negatives are the sensor for the automatic shut off is way too sensitive, if you dont have it pretty close to PERFECTLY flat it goes out which is a pain. Also there is no heat control so once it’s first lit it’s just barely staying lit, can’t have any wind blow on it or it goes out, plus once the honeycomb section is lit well finally and red it’s burning propane at such a low rate heat does not blow out of it, it only rises from it. I guess the plus to that is low propane consumption but it would be nice to be able to crank it up if you want to blow some heat at you. This is a new school version of a metal coffee can with a roll of toilet paper inside soaked in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol. ', ""These things do a good job of heating my small fish house, but it does not take long and they get hard to light and won't work Have gone through three in three ice fishing seasons.. The regular size Mr. Heater is more reliable and I should probably just stick with those but the smaller size and a bit less btu's just works better in my tiny and very well insulated fish house.Have tried the cleaning method described in the manual but it is very hard to take apart and nothing seems to help."", 'Bought 3 fir use to heat bedrooms in the house during power outages.  Just arrived and a week later a planned one day power outage.  With new born baby, needed to ensure both mom and baby would stay warm.  Used the heater and it was fine.  ', ""I have the larger Mr. Heater for our sailboat works great! So I bought this for our RTT roof top tent ..works good don't get as hot which is good for a tent ,But! the base that holds the 1lb tank should be twice the size feels like it could fall over .I plan on fabricating a larger base :)                                                                        -=CC=-"", ""Not cheap. It is tippy with the 1 lb cylinder. I asked Mr Heater for a parts list to hard pipe it directly to a 5 lb or 20 lb cylinder and I got parts list for using a hose. I don't want to use a hose. I like that it is quiet. I like that you don't need matches. I wish it had more than 1 heat output setting. It seems to be the best match available of heat output needed for my collapsible fish house."", ""I used this in my motorhome to keep the chill off at night and not have to use the furnace, which runs the batteries down significantly while boon-docking. It will run for 6 hours on one propane bottle, so it will not last all night. However, if you start it at midnight, it will run until 6 AM, at which time you can turn on your furnace for a short time if you're an early riser. Alternatively, if you don't want to run the furnace in order to save batteries, you could light the burners on your stove. Be sure to crack a window so as not to deplete all the oxygen. This unit works well."", ""Light weight. Compact.It doesn't take up allot of space. Easy to use. Does a good job heating my Ice Fishing Hub perfectly.

Lasko Electric Ceramic Oscillating Space Heater 1500-Watt with Remote-Control,75.58,30-day returns,"[""This is the 3rd purchase of the same heater.  1st for one of my sons, 2nd for my boss and 3rd to replace a noisy old heater at my desk.  Not only does it produce heat well but it is also is aesthetically pleasing in an office setting.  Those points combined with many levels of heat to chose from and a remote control feature to boot...perfection!!  Three purchases and each for less than $60...it's a winner!!"", ""The reason I wanted this heater was I needed supplemental heat to my daughters room which is the furthest from the central heating system and surrounded by three ouside walls. Have been using a small oscillating ceramic heater for a couple years, but not thermostat controlled. Love the Lasko, cause it heats room evenly and quickly! Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature. If you can run it on High which draws 12-14 Amps then it will work well for you! Why they disable temperature controlled operation in Low mode is baffling to me! ', 'This heater is a pretty good source of additional warmth where you need it. You may get tired of people asking you what it is though... It will not heat an entire home, but in my 22x28 living room, it does a pretty good job warming things up. Quiet and pretty. The remote works great, (even though it is almost as weird of a shape as the heater).', ""The heater is very dependable , I've had one for 1 year now. I have purchased two additional for other rooms. These units do the job of heating rooms well. They're very fashionable convenient."", 'first off gotta say this heater warms a medium size room very fast..and very wellalso easy to operate. only problem is the heater is very noise. looked over the reviewspeople said very quit very little sound NOT true loud fan and when oscillating is onmakes a verroom verroom sound [ best way to describe it]  gonna need to get out theear plugs gave it four stars for its heating', ""This little heater is great for taking the chill out of the air. My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me. (Don't rely on this heater being your main source of heat but rather as a supplement)."", ""expertbenefitsI haven't had it too long but it fits my purpose. I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable. It kind of cute too!"", 'I like the design of the heater very much and it certainly has enough output to heat what I intended it for.  I also like the features that it offers.  The only thing that I wish it did and it does not do is turn back on when the thermostat goes below what it is set at as well as turn off when it reaches the temperature.  All in all though, it is a good value and I have been pleased with it.', ""Granted it's not more than 1000 square feet, but this pretty little heater sits in the center of my house and keeps the whole house comfortable.  It has a thermostat,  (only 5 degree increments) but still will save me money by shutting off when the room is warm enough.  It has a convenient remote control.  First time I used it I smelled some electrical burning sent.  It only lasted a little while.

"Mr. Heater Portable Buddy Camping, Job Site Propane Gas Heater MH9BX (For Parts)",75.0,Last item available,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']",,14.25in.,9in.,,20 gal,,,14.25 in,,,,Battery,3,"F232000, MH9BX",,,,Mr. Heater,Copper,4000-9000 BTU,Heater,Rotary Knob,Heat Pump,,MH9BX,,,Floor,,,Unknown,,,Black,,,0089301320000,6 hrs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEW Lasko 3PL 6435 Designer Oscillating Ceramic Heater Convection RC Tower,75.98, ,"[""This is the 3rd purchase of the same heater.  1st for one of my sons, 2nd for my boss and 3rd to replace a noisy old heater at my desk.  Not only does it produce heat well but it is also is aesthetically pleasing in an office setting.  Those points combined with many levels of heat to chose from and a remote control feature to boot...perfection!!  Three purchases and each for less than $60...it's a winner!!"", ""The reason I wanted this heater was I needed supplemental heat to my daughters room which is the furthest from the central heating system and surrounded by three ouside walls. Have been using a small oscillating ceramic heater for a couple years, but not thermostat controlled. Love the Lasko, cause it heats room evenly and quickly! Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature. If you can run it on High which draws 12-14 Amps then it will work well for you! Why they disable temperature controlled operation in Low mode is baffling to me! ', 'This heater is a pretty good source of additional warmth where you need it. You may get tired of people asking you what it is though... It will not heat an entire home, but in my 22x28 living room, it does a pretty good job warming things up. Quiet and pretty. The remote works great, (even though it is almost as weird of a shape as the heater).', ""The heater is very dependable , I've had one for 1 year now. I have purchased two additional for other rooms. These units do the job of heating rooms well. They're very fashionable convenient."", 'first off gotta say this heater warms a medium size room very fast..and very wellalso easy to operate. only problem is the heater is very noise. looked over the reviewspeople said very quit very little sound NOT true loud fan and when oscillating is onmakes a verroom verroom sound [ best way to describe it]  gonna need to get out theear plugs gave it four stars for its heating', ""This little heater is great for taking the chill out of the air. My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me. (Don't rely on this heater being your main source of heat but rather as a supplement)."", ""expertbenefitsI haven't had it too long but it fits my purpose. I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable. It kind of cute too!"", 'I like the design of the heater very much and it certainly has enough output to heat what I intended it for.  I also like the features that it offers.  The only thing that I wish it did and it does not do is turn back on when the thermostat goes below what it is set at as well as turn off when it reaches the temperature.  All in all though, it is a good value and I have been pleased with it.', ""Granted it's not more than 1000 square feet, but this pretty little heater sits in the center of my house and keeps the whole house comfortable.  It has a thermostat,  (only 5 degree increments) but still will save me money by shutting off when the room is warm enough.  It has a convenient remote control.  First time I used it I smelled some electrical burning sent.  It only lasted a little while.  Seems fine now.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Brand New Genuine High Quality Lasko Automatic Airflow Heater,79.99, ,"[""With the cold grip of a long winter making the house too chilly to stay comfortable, I looked for some space heaters to help out the central A/C system. After checking out just about all of the available products on the market, I spotted the Lasko 5812 heater on Ebay- the ONLY one I could find that directs warm air into the room from the bottom of the unit at floor level. For its size, this compact ceramic heater does a good job of keeping my feet warm and taking the chill out of any room where it is employed. A bigger than expected fan motor, quiet operation and good performance makes this a 'top pick' portable heater for the price."", ""Best heater on the market, so far. Heat where ever you put it very efficiently to the point, at times, I findmyself turning it down. Have one in my room, and the bathroom, which I let my brother hold for his room, so gonna get another for the bathroom, and one for the kitchen, because we're rarely in the living room. We're able to turn the gas hear off for the entire winter, and use it only to cook and wash clothes, with agas bill of less than $40 a month. The electric is a little higher than normal due to the heater, but nowherenear what utilities would normally cost with the gas included. So yes, this heater does actually save you a lot of money in other areas. And it's extremely sturdy, with a tip over mechanism that works even if the heater is slightly tilted.  Highly recommend. "", ""This has been the very best room heater i have ever purchased it keeps the whole room very warm i can even feel it from 5 feet away constructed like a regular furnace but much smaller don't let the size fool you this little heater will put out the heat baby and i will be buying more of them if they are still in stock i would recommend the Lasko 5812 anytime. thanks guys for a great deal that was well worth every penny."", 'It is the most powerful heater I have owned. The first Lasko 5812 lasted 8 and one half years. It gives more heat on high as the duraflame cabinet heater I purchased for $100.00 this past fall. I should have bought another one of these to heat my larger room.', ""This is a great little heater. It takes the chill out of a room. It is small so it doesn't take up much room and has a safety feature which turns it off when tipped over."", 'i like that the heat comes outof the bottom at floor level . heats the room very fast.so far no problems.like the heat control thermostat.', 'great space heater! - compact, easy on-off switch and setting dial, strong flow, quiet, and best of all, even distribution of soft, warm heat. - very satisfied, AAA+. thank you.', 'Great heaters to heat rooms that you are occupying without breaking your bank account.', 'Using this in bathroom on winter mornings; does not get too hot as some can - safer to use.', 'I just got it yesterday.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Heater with Remote Control - Features Built-in Lasko 751320 Ceramic Tower Space,75.99, ,"['I giving it 4 stars because when I started it for the first time.. It gave weird smell for about an hour or so. After that it has been working excellent. Its very easy to setup. Nothing much needed, just plug and start. It comes with a remote control using which we can control the temperature and speed. When I was at graduate school, my friend used to have it for his room since that room used to be cold in our apartment. It used to work fine there, so I purchased for my room at my current apartment.

It can warm up the room quickly with different temperature setup2. It has the auto feature where it goes to sleep mode when the temperature in room reaches the set value and restarts whenever it goes lower beyond the set value3. It can oscillate like a tower fan and distribute the heat across the room4. Its light weightCons:1. It has the remote but during night you cant see the temperature that we have set on this humidifier. Having a display in the remote or on the humidifier itself', ""This is the second one I've purchased. The heater itself is a good value, and the oscillating feature, and remote control are an added bonus. Used my first purchase in my camper (2 years and still going strong). This one's for our home's enclosed porch."", ""I think the heater works well, But when you have a power outage you have to reset it to keep area warm. The controls don't allow it to pick up where, hear left off trying to heat area.   So that make this heater, not reliable for keeping kids warm, pets,  plants.  In the areas I have lived would even help prevent frozen water lines.  I makes heater like this only good for you if, your attending it.  If this heat had manual controls it would be better. or had a program to reboot and maintain a pre-set temp,  by factory or,  by the user.  Myself I like a electric  heater that works  as lone as I have power.  And  starts back up after a power outage.  Have a great day."", ""This heater doesn't oscillate on all the temperatures. Only oscillates from 75 and up."", 'Got this heater for my camp trailer. Might as well use a candle for heat.  . It would be fine if it had a fan inside it. Cant use it will look for something else that blows the heat out .

Heat Storm HS-1500-PHXG Open Box New ,75.0,Last item available,"['Some much quieter &amp; smaller than my 10 year old infrared heater. Both 1500W. Too new to give it 5 🌟’s but if it lasts 10 years it will be worth every penny!I purchased a 1000W Heat Storm infrared heater, a couple years ago, for 12x12 enclosure and it heats the area easily during January &amp; February making the space useable year round.I really like the auto mode vs manual select high or low setting. Has the option to wall mount but since it is “portable” and I am only using it seasonally I won’t be using that feature. My sister in-law was so impressed she purchased 1 too.', 'Love the feature of hanging on wall and is very thin but powerful.', 'The product was very easy to install.  I chose to install on the wall and found success with no problems.  It preforms as stated in the advertising.  The only con I have to this point is the decibel level.  Just a tiny bit noisy.', 'I had high hopes for this heater, but after using it a couple weeks I’m really afraid it’s going to destroy my electricity as it runs full bore and I keep my house at 66. It only has a small area to heat as well. It never even goes off when temp reaches desired temp.', 'the heater works great', 'Great heater']",,5in.,4.50in.,,,,,18.75in.,,,,Electric,2,HS-1500-PHXG,Plastic,,,Heat Storm,,5200 BTU,Portable Heater,"Switch, Remote Control, Touch",Infrared,12 V,HS-1500-PHXG,150 ft²,"Portable, Wall-Mountable","Floor, Wall",1500 W,,,,,Gray,,,0854271005642,,,,,"Infrared, Compact",,,Radiant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unisex Adult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Heat Storm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9 Pounds,,,,,,,,,HS-1500-PHX-WIFI,No,China,,1,Tutorials and optional accessories: https://heatstorm.com/search?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,1 Lithium ion batteries required.
