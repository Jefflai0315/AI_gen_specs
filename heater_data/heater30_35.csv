Mr. Heater 5-foot Propane Hose Assembly for Grills and Gas Appliances.,34.99, ,"[""I bought two propane hoses 3 years ago, this one and one like it from the sports dept at Walmart.

"Lasko Model 100 MyHeat Personal Space Heater, Black - Compact Size, ",30.7,30-day returns,"['I bought this unit to build a yogurt maker.  My unit consumed 190 watts on a kill-a-watt meter.  This was much more heat than I needed.  I opened up the unit to see what I could change.  The internal connections are soldered.  I was quite surprised.  The heating element is center tap so it functions as two parallel heaters.  I cut a wire so I only use half the heater and it works very well.  It is a little over 100 watts now.   This could be used to make a dehydrator also.  I bought a $10 digital temperature to control this.  Yes I am an engineer but this project was easily within the capabilities of handy people.  Before messing with it the heater was surprisingly effective as a desk top heater or something like that to keep your hands warm.  Bear in mind the heat output is like that of two 100 watt incandescent light bulbs.  It has no tilt sensor so works in any attitude but does have an effective thermal switch that shuts it off.  ', 'Very simple little heater a bit taller then a coffie mug, the vent big as a baseball.  No adjustments, just an on/off switch puts out heat of around 150°F at 3"" away, 115° at 6"", 90° at 1 foot, 80° at 2 feet, which is great in  a small area, or spacific body parts (feet, face, hands or core) in a large area without worry of tripping breakers.  Just used my little cen-tech temperature gunto take the measurements.', 'I use this to heat my dog house.  I live in Iowa and so winter nights can be quite cold 5-6 months per year.  This is the 2nd one.  The first lasted 4 years.  Its very reliable.  I mount it on the outside of the dog house and direct the heat through a vent to the inside.  It works very well in the tough conditions I use it.   It puts out just the right amount of heat to heat the dog house without getting the inside to warm for the dog.  On cold nights my dog only comes out to eat, drink, and potty.  Then back in he goes.  As you can see my dog is spoiled. ', 'I just got this today and I already love it. At first I thought it was going to be a heater that filled a small room with heat but it does not, instead after some adjustment I have this tiny heater blowing on me while I sit at my computer desk to warm me up!.So really it should be blowing on you to get the ""Personal"" benefit out of it. would I recommend it? Defiantly yes! Especially for those cold days in cold rooms this Personal heater does make a difference!', 'Love this thing! It was just what I was looking for. Puts out great heat right where I need it. I keep it near for my chilly feet. Great quality and low cost to operate. The casing stays cool when operating too. Always use any heat device responsibly.I am so glad I made this purchase.', 'The Lasko 100 heater has worked very well since purchasing a month ago. I use it in a cool basement where I have my office and it has helped keep my feet and hands nice and toasty while on the computer. It also helps keep some of my tropical houseplants at a constant warmer temperature along with a plant light I am also using. It puts out a fair amount of heat and is surprisingly quiet. It has only two settings, off and on but that suits my needs very well. It never gets overly hot to the touch and is not top heavy so I do not worry about it tipping over. A bonus is that the little unit looks pretty good too and does not take up much space if that is a concern.', 'I have an office with limited power available.  A normal heater would blow the circuit breaker.  So, I needed a low power heater.  This is it.  It consumes 200 watts and the circuit breaker does not blow.  No it does not put out as much heat as the other heaters.  It consumes less energy and puts out less heat.  But, that was what I needed.  it was either this heater or nothing.  Keeps my feet warm.', 'this little heater did a great job, i bought it for my rv and it warmed it up in no time....not for winter use, but a great spring/fall supplement heater for those times you just want to take the dampness and chill out.', 'My office building does not allow space heaters that put out over 200 watts.  My office is cold, so I bought this small heater out of desperation.  It does not heat the office, but it definitely help me to stay warm when it is at my feet or on top of my desk while I am working.Grant G, Spokane Washington', 'i bought the heater for myself a month or so ago needing extra heat at night time. i was in a motorcycle accident and was paralyzed in 09 and im on blood thinners which in the winter you freexe. i put it on the table next to bed and i couldnt believe how much heat comes from this heater. anyways as far as the quality its great. the simple on off with no adjustment is perfect. if it gets too warm simply move it away a couple inches and vise versa. i think its a super nice heater for the price i highly recommend it. office, desktop, table top, night stand etc.... great little heater A1 in my book. brian']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Comfort Zone Heater Radiant Tower Space Heat Automatic Fuss-Free Operation,34.99, ,"[""This a very cost effective space heater to warm any area during a chilly winter, or - as we had during the early part of the Wisconsin spring - a slightly nippy start to spring. It works to warm a bedroom, normal sized living room (unsure of those with an open plan large setting), or a small area of a basement that you are working in. It has three settings, and has tip-over &amp; overheat protection. I like this product an awful lot, and thus I'll give it 4.5 stars. It does NOT have a remote, but I bought a separate one for that purpose. I am taking a half of a star off because EVEN though it does have tip over protection (meaning it shuts off in that case), it is slightly more easy to tip over than I thought it was. So if you have pets, it might NOT be the BEST idea to use it when they are out playing - NOT so much for safety sake, but to prevent your fur baby from getting injured stepping on it."", 'Works very well and set up takes only a few minutes...', ""This will be my last one.

Lasko CD08200 Bathroom Heater White Touch 3 Settings ALCI Safety Plug Tested,34.98, ,"[""I put this bathroom heater in my bedroom to compare with another good Lasko room heater of similar size and the same 1500 W but with different features. I like the angle of the heat blast from this bathroom heater better for when I'm sitting on my bed getting dressed in front of the heater, I am happier with the other in my office. which has a steeper angle of blast and a thermostat.I also use this bathroom heater in the bathroom for which it was intended. I wanted it above the sink level for safety, as there's nowhere else to put the heater but on the sink counter.  I  turned a fire safe small ceramic square kleenex holder upside down, and the heater's feet fit nicelyinside.This bathroom heater is convenient because of the one press button for a preset one hour of high heat for quick warmups such as in the bathroom or when getting dressed. No fussing with buttons. It also has High and Low settings that run without a timer.I also noticed that some sellers were saying their heaters were OK for the bathroom but the actual manufacturer did not.  This Bathroom heater is designed for the bathroom.  I'm not sure if the tripper in the cord is necessary if the outlet has one too, as many houses do these days in any water environment such as the bathroom or the kitchen.  I'm guessing the tripper in the plug reacts to the unit rather than the wall socket."", ""This heater does an excellent job of putting out a lot of air with the fan and also Heats the room excellently. For my application I'm using it in a fifth wheel trailer bathroom which is fairly small but one of the problems I'm having with the heater is I'm using a different thermostat on it that is more accurate to turn on and off and the heater shuts off and doesn't come back on when I use the thermostat on it so what you need to do is put something on the round button on top of the heater and tape it down to hold the button down all the time so that thermostat that I've got set up works properly and we'll kick the heater on when the temperature drops or more so when I want to heat the bathroom during a certain time of the day like when I take a shower.Otherwise the heater is an excellent heater and I would highly recommend anybody to buy it very good quality."", 'The heater is modern in design. It has a one hour feature that I love. I turn it on , shower get dressed in a warm bathroom, never have to wonder if I left it running. It automatically shuts off after 1 hour.', ""1. easy to turn on and off2. heats up fast3. has 1-hour auto shutoff4. very sturdy design, not likely to tip over5. made for humid areas like bathroomsbonus: it's cute!"", ""Here's the story:  To have my small bathroom warm when I get up in the morning for my shower, I had a small ceramic 1500 Watt heater connected into a wall timer to turn on automatically, and if I forgot (which I often did) to turn off automatically. With this Lasko heater, I tap the top when I'm ready to shower and it turns on high for one hour. Firstly, I don't have to remember to turn it off. Secondly, the velocity of the hot air coming out is so high that the bathroom heats up much quicker than my other heater, even though the wattage of both units is the same. This saves my electric bill.It seems to be good, quality wise, but it's only a month old now so we'll see.  November, 2020A note:  After it's turned off, and the top button (the big and only one) is tapped, it starts at the timed one hour 1500 Watt setting automatically."", ""It is difficult to find a space heater that is specifically for bathroom use. I was happy to find this one at this price and good reviews! It does exactly what I need it to do, I warm up my bathroom before a shower as my heat does not do that well - North side of house in Wisconsin! I will see how it holds up this winter, but so far very pleased with it's performance."", 'Works great! Instant heat . Small size is great. Comes with wet location plug  &amp; cord', ""Perfect replacement for my old heater that finally died. Small, lightweight, gets super warm in my little bathroom. Like that it's specifically made to use in a bathroom. Warming, the front grill can get hot!"", 'This little heater has all the power i need to heat up the bathroom in a hurry.

Three purchases and each for less than $60...it's a winner!!"", ""The reason I wanted this heater was I needed supplemental heat to my daughters room which is the furthest from the central heating system and surrounded by three ouside walls. Have been using a small oscillating ceramic heater for a couple years, but not thermostat controlled. Love the Lasko, cause it heats room evenly and quickly! Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature. If you can run it on High which draws 12-14 Amps then it will work well for you! Why they disable temperature controlled operation in Low mode is baffling to me! ', 'This heater is a pretty good source of additional warmth where you need it. You may get tired of people asking you what it is though... It will not heat an entire home, but in my 22x28 living room, it does a pretty good job warming things up. Quiet and pretty. The remote works great, (even though it is almost as weird of a shape as the heater).', ""The heater is very dependable , I've had one for 1 year now. I have purchased two additional for other rooms. These units do the job of heating rooms well. They're very fashionable convenient."", 'first off gotta say this heater warms a medium size room very fast..and very wellalso easy to operate. only problem is the heater is very noise. looked over the reviewspeople said very quit very little sound NOT true loud fan and when oscillating is onmakes a verroom verroom sound [ best way to describe it]  gonna need to get out theear plugs gave it four stars for its heating', ""This little heater is great for taking the chill out of the air. My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me. (Don't rely on this heater being your main source of heat but rather as a supplement)."", ""expertbenefitsI haven't had it too long but it fits my purpose. I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable. It kind of cute too!"", 'I like the design of the heater very much and it certainly has enough output to heat what I intended it for.  I also like the features that it offers.  The only thing that I wish it did and it does not do is turn back on when the thermostat goes below what it is set at as well as turn off when it reaches the temperature.  All in all though, it is a good value and I have been pleased with it.', ""Granted it's not more than 1000 square feet, but this pretty little heater sits in the center of my house and keeps the whole house comfortable.  It has a thermostat,  (only 5 degree increments) but still will save me money by shutting off when the room is warm enough.  It has a convenient remote control.  First time I used it I smelled some electrical burning sent.  It only lasted a little while.  Seems fine now.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Vornado EH1009106 Fan Heater - Brand New, , ,"['I live in Nebraska and put the Vornado in a 25’x12’ ventless corner basement room with 4 windows. It works adequately for that room. It takes 10-15 minutes on the high setting to heat entire room so I can’t imagine ever using the low setting there. Maybe in a smaller room or camper or a warmer climate it would be needed. The Vornado is so quiet and the heating element hardly glows, that when first turned on I wasn’t sure it was working. It has a safety switch on the bottom and needs to be placed on a hard flat surface. It’s very compact and the plastic exterior makes it lightweight. That exterior though doesn’t seem real sturdy so I’ve got it up off the floor to avoid getting kicked or trod on. For the price and purpose I’m satisfied.', ""After searching for a year for a replacement for our beloved Braun heater we have finally found one that works well. The Vornado is not the design leader that the old Braun was but it does come close on one of the most important features for us. We use this heater in a quiet office environment, therefore the heater has to be quiet. We tried a popular Fasco, a Caframo that is styled after the Braun, and other brands. All were too noisy. The Vornado is not whisper silent like the Braun, but it come close. The noise level is about like a modern computer.Other features we like on the Vornado are the 3 heat settings, a fairly accurate thermostat and a decent length cord. The design is upright where the Braun was low. The vertical design with the large blade fan helps the Vornado more more air which helps warm up the room more quickly. It has a discrete small red led light that lets you know it's on. The heater is made in China.The downsides of this heater are minor. The heat range selector switch is not intuitive and dimly marked. You need to shine a light on it and maybe consult the manual to remember what the cryptic I, II, III markings mean. (I=low, II=med, III=high). And the case is shiny plastic which is a static electricity magnet. It attracts dust and animal hair easily. These are small issues. We normally leave the unit on one heat setting and it is under the desk, so pretty much out of sight. The black case helps it hide. Overall the heater looks to be well made and it's doing its job well. The price is a little high for a simple heater, but we are happy with it."", ""This is the third one of these I have bought. While it has a maximum of 1500 watts, these heat a room the most evenly of anything you can buy. It is quiet and you won't get burned like other heaters. "", ""This is my second Vornado fan I've purchased. My first one is still working perfectly but I never want to be without one and may use this second one when I travel.  I live in a rental suite that is chilly in Spring and Fall. Despite how benign this fan looks it produces a significant amount of heat.  I only start the day running this heater on the 1000 Watt (medium) setting and then turn down to low for the remainder of the day. It heats my open floor plan living room and dining room exceptionally well without driving up the electrical bill. Cheaper than running the furnace or my natural gas fireplace (altho come winter we use that in conjunction with the heater fan).  Bear in mind this is the most reliable model. Other models of heater fans by Vornado do not have the longevity of this one yet still cost as much or more. Read the reviews and choose this model for great value."", ""This little room heater is outstanding. I bought it for my daughter's bedroom is she's on the second floor and as we heat with wood sometimes your room cools down below normal during the winter. This little heater keeps her room nice and toasty I would recommend it"", 'Heats the bedroom up quickly. Like the thermostat settings to keep room at even temp.', 'Compact size  heats a room in no time at all   I love it', 'Compact size', 'Quiet efficient small size unit=Love it', 'Vornado heaters are the only ones that I use, as they are dependable, quiet, and safe!  This one is the quietest one I have ever had and, like all Vornado heaters, warms my bedroom in about 2 minutes.  This is one great heater!']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr Heater F273699 Fuel Filter For Buddy Heaters NEW IN THE PACKAGE,30.0, ,"['This is the correct filter for using a hose with your Mr Heater. It filters oils that can come from the hose and any trash that might have found its way into hose. Arrived as advertised and ready to go.', ""Those little 1 lb. cylinders are great but if you want to heat for longer than a couple hours you'll find buying a 20 lb. propane tank, a long supply hose and a regulator a must.  My old Mr. Buddys used to work without a regulator but the new one I got wouldn't even light the pilot light without the regulator.  At any rate, I'm sitting warm and Mr. Buddy is working.  Do yourself a favor - even if you don't regularly use a big tank with Mr Buddy having the regulator and hose will give you peace of mind knowing should you need heat for a longer time you've got everything you need to stay warm.  It turns your propane heater from something you can use occasionally to knock the chill off into a heater you can depend on in an emergency."", 'Fuel filter kit matched up with my Mr. Heater without any issues. Works great.', ""I wish it weren't necessary to purchase these filters, because they are expensive and don't last particularly long.  However, they are absolutely necessary.  I learned the hard way with my first Mr. Buddy, which I ran with standard unfiltered propane canisters, which the Mr. Buddy is designed for.  In a season, the heater was hopelessly clogged and useless.  These filters will prevent that from happening.  The problem, unfortunately, is that, with the filters installed, standard canisters don't fit into the heater compartments that are designed to hold them.  The central promise of the Mr. Buddy—portability—is thus dead on arrival."", 'An excellent add-on to a Mr. Heater. Will keep the tiny orifice open and clear, if you are using a 20lbs propane tank. ', ""Have had a Big Buddy for several years as my space heater in the winter. Have always had this filter installed for protection. The filters aren't cheap, but you must have them as a blockage and the cleaning process thereafter is a pain. That's the only reason they are a good value."", 'This product came very fast and it really improve my tent heat performance. Before, I had trouble with the heater. Was hard to start and very hard to keep pilot fire lit. After installing it the pilot heats up fast and stays lit. Nice product, I bought two of them. Both heaters run excellent.', ""The hose I ordered does not require the fuel filter.  My error.  I'm only keeping it in case I buy one that does to run 2 tanks.  Not really a decorater item, so that idea is out.  Into the spares locker on the boat. "", 'Works as needed for Mr heater Buddy heaters.I mistakenly used a generic extension hose from 20lb propane bottle to Buddy heater a few times before the heater stopped working from ""goo"" which came from hose.This filter is much needed for Buddy heaters,I even use it for portable BBQ\'s for same reason.I did learn if the hose from bottle is made by Mr Heater it is fine without filter,true or not I have not tried it yet,Mr Heater uses different materiel for their hoses', ""I used my heaters 2 or 3 times without filter, never again.

Works better than expected and shipping was so quick. They were very kind. I'm satisfied."", 'This heater heats my bathroom, but it is so ""tiny"" and light weght, I\'m afraid it will easily be pulled, pushed or knocked over. I won\'t use it because of this.

The ceramic element generates Lots of heat for such a tiny unit, and the well placed little fan Throws the Heat About 6 Feet Out before it dissipates.

If you want a cheap space heater THAT KICKS LA BOOTY,.... I HIGHLY recommend this product.........

Well packaged, hopefully I won't need to use them but the way the weather has been getting it looks like it's going to be a cold one. Thanks for the rapid shipping and the great price."", 'Small and compact mighty joe young unit love it thanks', 'My girlfriend keeps it on her side of the bed and says it works perfectly at keeping her warm.

Handy Heater HEAT-MC12/4 Plug Outlet Speace Heater   NEW/ BOXED,30.0, ,"['I purchased this heater for a very specific purpose. I needed a small heater to dry out a wood window sill for a window located in a bathroom shower (long story). This heater satisfied all of my requirements which included: small enough to fit in the space between the storm window and double hung window, generate enough heat to dry the space without over heating, have a thermostat, and operate continuously for a prolonged period of time. I have not had any problems operating this unit on a heavy duty extension cord (not recommended in instructions). This unit will automatically turn on and off as it reaches the temperature you set for the unit. It produces just enough heat to satisfy my need. Criticisms regarding the 12 hour time limit can be resolved by plugging this unit into a timer. When the power is shut off and then back on, the unit will run again for 12 hours intervals solving the problem of having to be present to restart the unit. This unit must be suspended to prevent blockage of the air intake located on the bottom of the heater.', ""Quality feels good, not cheap. Plug rotation feature is secure and not wobbly or junky at all. Heater pulls 297 watts when running, but pulls ~750 watts for about 30 seconds when you turn it on from cold. This is a powerful little heater, you would not want to put your hand directly in front of it for very long. Definitely enough to heat a very small space like a car, or heat up a small room which isn't quite warm enough. Has a thermostat which works well. The heater will run the fan for a bit and cycle down just as it should. It has a red LED which always stays on and give the impression of a hot surface so that you don't forget that the grill could still be hot.The heater sucks air in from the bottom where the fan is.Honestly, this thing has better construction and features than most space heaters I've owned.Cannot yet speak to reliability but based on the good circuit design it should last quite a long time."", 'We have an L shaped bath room and the  baseboard heater is on the long side. On cold days the far corner of the short side gets cold.  This gadget is perfect, set temperature and  shave in comfort. easy to use, takes no space. I saved about  $1200 by not adding another baseboard floor heater when  a $12 heater is perfect.  Kudos to the designer for a great product !!Ol George', 'I wanted this for a very small seedling starter greenhouse but will be unable to use it as it shuts off after 12 hours.  Also when you turn it back on it starts at 90 degrees.  You have to reset the temp and timer every time you turn it back on.  I also bought one for my daughter to use in her tack room for two barn cats but she is also disappointed because of the 12 hour turn off feature.  Only useful if you are there to turn it back on and reset every 12 hours.', 'While this thinks key feature is size, It works well.  Unfortunately the the other plug in a two receptacle outlet cannot be used while this is plugged in.  It blocks the free receptacle partially enough to render it non-usable. It does produce some small fast heat to a rathed general localized area. Is it worth $20.00?  Yes if you will use often, no if you dont require the convenience of it.  Cheaper and more effective heaters are available, its really based on the buyers preference and intended use.  Works great for heating up bathroom when done with showering.  I would reccomend this if you find yourself seeing it  be applicable in a scenario.  ', 'This is a great heater for a small area.I plan on using it for a walk in closet that seems to not get heated very well.I can turn this little guy on for five minutes or so and the problem is solved', 'Better than i expected because the plug works both ways into the outlet, this is good 4 me cause all my outlets are upside down &amp; heater has timer , &amp; low &amp; high..  compact &amp; small, low price i really thinks thats great.  Thx.', 'I love the fact that these heaters have a ground connection.  The third pole helps stabilize the heater in the socket and keeps it from leaning and possibly falling out, like the socket heaters with only two poles.  They are great for a small room like a bathroom. ', ""It is very small but it put out some nice heat for it's size.  I like the thermostat feature so it goes off when it gets to that temperature.  "", 'I’ve given 5 of these as gifts. They are perfect for a bathroom or office or reading area. They are powerful but only heat a small area. Buy using it in the morning by my chair while I read the paper or file paperwork I do not have to turn up my furnace. I can pre heat a bathroom when it’s below zero outside and avoid freezing the second I step out of the shower!Not intended to warm large rooms.

"Ac Heat register vent Fan Booster W/ Built In Thermostat 3"" x 10"" 4"" x 10"" White",34.99, ,"['Bought this booster fan to direct warm air into a utility room that has no heat.

It took a little bit to get it adjusted, but now whenever the heat is on in the den the fan comes on and draws it into the utility room, making a big difference in temperature.  A few minutes after the heat in the den shuts off, the booster fan shuts off.Overall a nice booster fan that runs quiet, efficiently, and gets the job done.', 'Bought for a room farthest from my furnace.

500-Watt Ceramic Small Space Personal Mini Heater - Black,30.63,30-day returns,"[""It's good for what it is, but older models that it was designed after preformed better with more air flow from a more powerful fan. Its still nice to have in a small closed room, as long as it's not freezing. And yes the front does get hot as described by other reviews, but cools down and heats up quickly  as well. Good engineering and quality, priced right, although I did get a deal on it at half price but after shipping I still payed full price. Would be awesome in a tent. Overall I'm satisfied under the circumstances. Besides its a keep sake in memory of a life once lived, LOL!"", ""It's very nice and works well. The only thing that freaked me out is the accompanied paperwork informing me that the state of California says that this product may cause cancer - super weird. But it works for my tiny space and I generally use it in the early morning and late evening."", ""All the photos and customer photos make it look like a tiny speaker that can fit in your palm. That is soo not the case. It's pretty big. But I really like it. And I like the shape. The heat output is nice. I can't wait for winter. I got it to do my Jamberry nails. This was cheaper than the Jamberry heater. That's a five pd bag of flour btw.Update: so it's Feb 2021 and I've actually used it to keep warm too. It's been super cold where I am. Also where I work! So I get to use this when I'm freezing and it's magical. I feel so deliciously warm. I love that if it's knocked over in the slightest it turns off. Super safe!"", 'Great little ceramic heater. Perfect for my needs. Quiet and well made.', 'Excellent product just as described, highly recommended.', 'Love this little heater so much ', 'It was listed as a battery operated heater. Not true.
