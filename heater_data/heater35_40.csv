NEW Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681) FREE SHIPPING. ,39.5, ,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product? It really depends upon your application need. I put this in my truck due to no floor board heat. It does help but the heat is so so at best. The blow power is very minimal but it does help for my application']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Lasko Elite Collection Revolution Full-Room Ceramic Heater CC23630 with Remote,39.95,23 sold,"['I live in Oakland, California in the USA. The usual temperature here during winter nights goes between 35 to 40 something degrees Fahrenheit. I use it to warm up a small room (10 feet x 10 feet x 8 feet, without insulation). I usually turn it on with maximum temperature and speed for around 20 minutes. The room would be heat up to reasonably warm. Usually, I could turn the heater off for about half an hour before I need to turn it on again.', 'Great small room space heater.  Simple controls.  Quiet but not so quiet you forget and leave it on.  Only wish I knew heating watts on the low heat setting.  Have not put the thermostat into use yet...maybe try to use it/get the heater cycling at some warm bathroom temperature in the winter.', ""This unit is closely-related to the one (same brand &amp; features) I've been using these past 5+ years.  A reliable workhorse, with a bonus: It turns into a no-heat fan in the summer!!  Fits compactly under my desk."", 'This little heater has amazing power. It is small . I use it on a medium setting and it heats a very large area. No need to turn it all the way up. I’m very happy with this heater.', ""I've had many space heaters over the years, but this one is a gem: a high-quality product that works well and quickly. It's the quietest heater I've ever had. The oscillating heating tower guarantees the whole room gets warm. The tower design is sleek, and the whole unit takes up little space. This machine has heft and seems well made. Though it's about 3-times taller than it is wide, most of the weight is in the base, which makes it feel solid and not prone to tipping over easily. I'm so in love with this baby that I'm buying a second -- FOR MY 3-ROOM APARTMENT!! lolI wholeheartedly recommend this product."", ""Received this tower fan and it's very sturdy, has several settings: air, low heat and higher heat. Large enough to heat a medium sized room; only complaint is it smells a bit antiseptic."", 'I have not actually used my LASKO 5370 Ceramic/ Oscillating Heater yet. I purchased the LASKO Name. Have always had longevity with their products. I highly recommend.', ""Very appropriate for heating a small space - generates desired heat; good price and good design...would have been rated a '5 star' if it has an auto shut off when desired room temp is reached."", 'This product works well, is easy to move around to different locations, and keeps me cozy when I am chilled.  I would recommend it to others!  ', ""Almost bought the more expensive model because it came with a remote. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and found one in here!

Road Pro 12-Volt Direct Hook-Up Ceramic Heater/ Fan with Swivel Base RPSL_681,39.99, ,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product? It really depends upon your application need. I put this in my truck due to no floor board heat. It does help but the heat is so so at best. The blow power is very minimal but it does help for my application']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Attach thermostat wires inside unit. Screw in the 4 bolts that hold unit in place. Done. You got a fan in your Mr Heater Unit. I'm my opinion unit should be sold with fan installed.

It doesn't have a thermostat, so it runs all the time it's on, but, it does have over heat protection. It's suppose to have a switch to kick it off if it's knocked over, but, either it doesn't, or mine doesn't work. However, the case doesn't get hot, so I'm not really to concerned  I used mine to blow heat under my bed when it's cold, it's small enough that it sets below my box springs, so it's not blowing on the bed but under it. It serves my purpose perfectly.

I use it for my feet but if it\'s really cold in the space that it\'s being used in, it wouldn\'t be enough heat to be effective even for something like feet.The only reason I bought this one is because my previous order for the same heater was cancelled by \tXA-ELECTRONICS.  First they sent me an email that they were refunding my money with no explanation then later an email arrived saying the reason for the cancelled transaction was that ""The seller says that both of you disagreed over the terms of the transaction"".  This is completely untrue because I had nothing to say about it, so it was just a complete waste of time for me and I still have no idea why they cancelled it without any explanation.  i tried to contact them about this but haven\'t received a response.I would definitely support JONI-MARKET for their extremely fast shipping and excellent service but unless you want a lot of games with extremely poor communication I would avoid like the plague XA-ELECTRONICS for any purchases.', ""When I received this...

Mr Heater MH9BX Portable Heater,65.0, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.

This item, described as a milk house heater, is smaller and puts out less heat than anticipated.  At its highest setting, I can warm my hands placed right in front of it, which is better than nothing.  On the plus side, the case does not get too hot to touch or to place on work bench, and the unit will shut off if tipped over.

By the way.  If you bag into on and it gets not down.  The heater quickly shuts completely off.  This was a safety feature that was key for my purchase.  Also.  They are made of all medal.  You don't get any residual smile of plastic smiles blowing in your face.  Another espect of this heater that I completely enjoy.  So far they are very durable and if you have a crazy cat name Recon like I do and he flies across the room and knocks the heater over.  The fear of a boat fear is no in the picture...

Those points combined with many levels of heat to chose from and a remote control feature to boot...perfection!!  Three purchases and each for less than $60...it's a winner!!"", ""The reason I wanted this heater was I needed supplemental heat to my daughters room which is the furthest from the central heating system and surrounded by three ouside walls. Have been using a small oscillating ceramic heater for a couple years, but not thermostat controlled. Love the Lasko, cause it heats room evenly and quickly! Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature. If you can run it on High which draws 12-14 Amps then it will work well for you! Why they disable temperature controlled operation in Low mode is baffling to me! ', 'This heater is a pretty good source of additional warmth where you need it. You may get tired of people asking you what it is though...

My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me.

I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable. It kind of cute too!"", 'I like the design of the heater very much and it certainly has enough output to heat what I intended it for.  I also like the features that it offers.

All in all though, it is a good value and I have been pleased with it.', ""Granted it's not more than 1000 square feet, but this pretty little heater sits in the center of my house and keeps the whole house comfortable.

Lasko 754200 Portable Hm/Office Personal Electric 1500W Ceramic Space Heater ,39.95, ,"['Been using it now for nearly 2 weeks; brutal Ohio winters make this a necessity.  It\'s compact, light and fits just about anywhere.  They do warn that it can discolor floors/carpets etc so I have it on top of a small waist-height cabinet with a piece of glass under it to protect the surface.  I\'m using it in a 12x12 office, and it is more than adequate to the task.  So far I\'ve used it on the first (lower power) setting at about a ""4"" heat setting (about 1/3 of max).  It puts out a tremendous amount of heat with a far reaching blower.  My only reservation is that it\'s a bit loud compared to my old heatwe (a trusty Bionaire I\'d had for about 12 years which finally gave up the ghost).   Can\'t comment on quality/longevity yet but for the money, it\'s a great buy and I recommend it.  As with any portable heating product, I would not run this when no one is in the room to monitor it. ', ""It serves my purpose very well.  My feet are perpetually cold, and these are perfect for that.  These units last a good 3 to 4 years before they start to get a little less efficient and effective. Eventually they do stop working.  Brand new, these are great heaters.  Very quiet heating unit.  Fan isn't overly loud and puts out a good amount of heat at the low setting.  I rarely use it at the high setting until it starts getting older.  I have gone thru 2 of these units in a 10 to 11 year period.  My 2nd one (about 5 years old) is starting to waiver.  I'd suggest getting some compressed air and blowing out the dust that collects at the intake on the rear of the unit to make it last longer.  The one thing I wish it had was a safety sensor that automatically turns it off if it gets tipped over. It does NOT have any safety feature so be mindful about leaving it on!"", 'I bought a pair of these just in case I experienced a furnace problem and needed some heat while getting it repaired or perhaps wanted to heat the garage a bit while working there.  They seem well built, run very quietly and would likely produce 1500 watts at 120 volts (I got 1440 at 117.7 volts).  The lower setting produced about 930 watts at 119 volts.  The cord is 16 AWG with 105C rating, which appears adequately sized.  Although I did not test them for very long, the heaters and fan did turn off when the temperature setting was reduced to a very low level.  My only qualm, for which I reduced a star,  is that there is no switch to turn them off if overturned.  I rotated the units in all directions, but they kept running.  So I would make sure that they are not used on a flammable surface or any possible source of overturning is excluded.  I did not test if the overheating reset would ever turn them off.', 'This heater did a nice job of heating my area at work.  I sit near an outside wall that is very cold some days.  This heater kept me toasty for about six hours then blew the circuit breaker at work.  This item could be improved with an internal resettable circuit breaker protruding from the rear so IT would blow instead of the one at work.  That would be more convenient instead of me being required to call an electrician at work to fix the work breaker.', 'Great little heater that puts out a lot of heat. I live in a converted space that has no central heating, so this little guy is my only source of heat and it does great. Keeps me toasty all night long at about 1/3 of maximum. My only caveat is that it has no tip-over protection. If the dog brushes against the back of it and knocks it over, it does not automatically shut off.', 'Bought this so we did not have to run the heater all night. This little heater works GREAT. Keeps are room at whatever temperature we set the knob at and heats up our master bedroom FAST. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because after we unplug it from the outlet, the actual plug is HOT. We had to switch to a power strip as we were afraid the heater might blow a fuse as it seems to use a lot of electricity to power.', 'For a small heater it does a really good job.  It is also excellent for small rooms.  The only perk is that the handle is too smallto get a good hold.  But overall great little heater, love the feature it turns on and off automatically by it self when needed!', ""Prior owner. This is the best small space heater. This warms an area very fast. It isn't heavy. The face does get warm. Please just be careful. I recv'd this very quickly. It is really a fair price. Very well built. The previous space heater is still working, about 7 years now. I was just tired of moving it around. It IS that good. Buy this heater. You won't regret this. Just be careful. Thank you!"", ""This little heater will run you out of a 500 sq ft room if left on high. It's no joke. Lasko is a decent brand, not high end but should last 2-3 years....or more but for for 20.00 what would you expect. Dials are easy and built in temperature regulator is a must. I love mine and think it's a great value. I once ran a lasko fan straight 24 hrs - 7 days a week for 2 years without any issue. It started to rust from the moisture in the area or it would probably still be running. Good purchase and I am very pleased."", ""I think a lot of space heaters between 20-40$ are all the similar, they all break or are just as good as broken by the end of the season. This space heater seems of much better quality, even the material seems of high quality, instead of plastic like most. I also like that it's small and wisper quite. I have no complaints. I got it for 20$ which was a fantastic deal but I would have paid 35$ or even more for a heater with this quality. My biggest pro is the size.  Love it!!!""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Presto Heat Dish Parabolic Electric Heater Model 0792201,40.0,30-day returns,"[""I use this heater in my clinic and my patients absolutely love it. It's amazing how quickly it heats a room without air blasting or noise. It has a nice safety feature where it makes a horrible noise if it's tipping over (it only happens if I'm moving it when it's on). In fact several of my patients have gone out and bought their own for home. I should get a commission."", 'I have an old 1911 craftsman style house with no insulation.  My heating system is an outdated oil furnace.  As we all know the price of fuel is always fluctuating and seems like it is going to stay that way.  It costs me about $300.00 a month in the winter.  Which is ridiculous, especially when the heat just does not stay in the house for long.I needed a knew plan and changing out the heat system or insulating the house is not an option at this time.  So I went out and bought the presto heatdish.  It produces so much heat that during the winter I no longer had to heat the entire house to stay warm.  I would just carry the heatdish around with me, saving me hundreds of dollars month to month.  I had a few other electric heaters before I purchased this one and the difference is night and day.I  have had this heater for almost 3 years now and it still works as well as the day I purchased it.  It paid for itself in its first week work.  With as much use as this gets I would of expected it to burn out a while ago, but that is not the case.The drawbacks: It does not have an automatic turn off system if it were to fall over, but it does have an alarm that is unmistakably loud.   There is also a footlight that you cannot turn off or on, but you can just take out the lightbulb if that bothers you.Great product and highly recommended. Thanks for reading.', ""Proven, ancient technology that outperforms the daylights of newer, highly rated products. It's effective (heats the room quickly and thoroughly), efficient (only 1,000 watts), safe (automatic shut-off features), and built to last. Sometimes a product cannot be improved upon.  "", 'It gives off a good amount of heat but it has one big design flaw where the dish can not be tilted. This means the dish is in a fixed position which points into the air slightly. So if the surface you place it on is taller than you are while seated you will struggle to feel it. The safety tip over buzzer also prevents you from sliding something underneath it to tilt it yourself.', ""This is a wonderful heater.  I am a smoker and visit my family a lot.  I choose to smoke in the garage there and my sister in law bought this for me to use in the garage. It warms up quickly for the immediate area and it doesn't take long for the surrounding areas to warm up either. Once this gets going I don't even need a coat.  (Ohio area)  I have a house with very tall ceilings in the master bedroom and living area.  In the winter this little heater warms up quickly, even going right to the high setting.  I always have to turn it way back too.  I am widowed now and I don't need to keep the entire house warm, just where I am.  I do recommend this.  Oh, it is safe, if you move it at all when it is on you get a loud buzz sound!  If on the fence about it I would go with it."", 'Great price, lightweight, energy efficient. It has worked very well so far. The price was the best I found on Ebay. I think the design is very good. The shape of the dish plus the shiny interior helps it be much more efficient than a regular space heater. It gets very hot very fast. It also has a buzzer in case it tips over. A great all around heater to warm a person up fast.', ""These are fabulous heaters (radiant warmth, like the sun) and are in great condition.At first they didn't quite meet my needs, because I needed them to point straight ahead, whereas they are angled slightly upward and this is not adjustable. However, I set each heater on a slanted platform (which I made out of heavy cardboard), and now they meet my needs perfectly. (Parabolic heat dish heaters warm whatever is directly in front of them, within about, say, 15 feet.) You won't believe how much glowing warmth they put out!Also, Rob was great to do business with."", ""I live in a 1920's craftsman style house with poor insulation. This heater is wonderful and has allowed me to turn my thermostat down several degrees and still be comfortable here in Minnesota. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could because it is actually a little bit large to walk around in a small house with small rooms.  But that said, even set as low as it will go, it still puts out a lot of heat. In fact, I have to be careful not to put it in a room near my thermostat because the furnace will not come on at all if I do!  I have already recommended it to friends."", 'This heat dish pumps out heat so intensely it’s like a dryer for your cloths if sitting in front of it. I could feel it’s radiant heat from about 15ft away. Wayyyy better than other heat dish I had no contest. It does not oscillate and no remote only 2 features not on this probably because it is heavy duty. This is the best heat dish, look no further. ', ""I had a socially distanced bourbon tasting party for four on my back patio during January 2021 in Chicago. My neighbor had two of the Presto dishes so I ordered two more. Even though the evening's temperature dipped into the mid-20s, all four of us were completely comfortable sitting in our patio chairs with a our own Presto dish to keep us warm.

"Lasko CD08200 Ceramic Bathroom, Indoor, Portable Space Heater, 1500-Watt",37.99, ,"[""I put this bathroom heater in my bedroom to compare with another good Lasko room heater of similar size and the same 1500 W but with different features. I like the angle of the heat blast from this bathroom heater better for when I'm sitting on my bed getting dressed in front of the heater, I am happier with the other in my office. which has a steeper angle of blast and a thermostat.I also use this bathroom heater in the bathroom for which it was intended. I wanted it above the sink level for safety, as there's nowhere else to put the heater but on the sink counter.  I  turned a fire safe small ceramic square kleenex holder upside down, and the heater's feet fit nicelyinside.This bathroom heater is convenient because of the one press button for a preset one hour of high heat for quick warmups such as in the bathroom or when getting dressed. No fussing with buttons. It also has High and Low settings that run without a timer.I also noticed that some sellers were saying their heaters were OK for the bathroom but the actual manufacturer did not.  This Bathroom heater is designed for the bathroom.  I'm not sure if the tripper in the cord is necessary if the outlet has one too, as many houses do these days in any water environment such as the bathroom or the kitchen.  I'm guessing the tripper in the plug reacts to the unit rather than the wall socket."", ""This heater does an excellent job of putting out a lot of air with the fan and also Heats the room excellently. For my application I'm using it in a fifth wheel trailer bathroom which is fairly small but one of the problems I'm having with the heater is I'm using a different thermostat on it that is more accurate to turn on and off and the heater shuts off and doesn't come back on when I use the thermostat on it so what you need to do is put something on the round button on top of the heater and tape it down to hold the button down all the time so that thermostat that I've got set up works properly and we'll kick the heater on when the temperature drops or more so when I want to heat the bathroom during a certain time of the day like when I take a shower.Otherwise the heater is an excellent heater and I would highly recommend anybody to buy it very good quality."", 'The heater is modern in design. It has a one hour feature that I love. I turn it on , shower get dressed in a warm bathroom, never have to wonder if I left it running. It automatically shuts off after 1 hour.', ""1. easy to turn on and off2. heats up fast3. has 1-hour auto shutoff4. very sturdy design, not likely to tip over5. made for humid areas like bathroomsbonus: it's cute!"", ""Here's the story:  To have my small bathroom warm when I get up in the morning for my shower, I had a small ceramic 1500 Watt heater connected into a wall timer to turn on automatically, and if I forgot (which I often did) to turn off automatically. With this Lasko heater, I tap the top when I'm ready to shower and it turns on high for one hour. Firstly, I don't have to remember to turn it off. Secondly, the velocity of the hot air coming out is so high that the bathroom heats up much quicker than my other heater, even though the wattage of both units is the same. This saves my electric bill.It seems to be good, quality wise, but it's only a month old now so we'll see.  November, 2020A note:  After it's turned off, and the top button (the big and only one) is tapped, it starts at the timed one hour 1500 Watt setting automatically."", ""It is difficult to find a space heater that is specifically for bathroom use. I was happy to find this one at this price and good reviews! It does exactly what I need it to do, I warm up my bathroom before a shower as my heat does not do that well - North side of house in Wisconsin! I will see how it holds up this winter, but so far very pleased with it's performance."", 'Works great! Instant heat . Small size is great. Comes with wet location plug  &amp; cord', ""Perfect replacement for my old heater that finally died. Small, lightweight, gets super warm in my little bathroom.

"Mr. Heater F242010 MH4GC Golf Cart Heater,Silver and Black",37.99, ,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

DeLonghi Ceramic Heater Quiet 1500 Watt Digital Adjustable 3 Heat Settings Box,40.0, ,"['LOVE this space heater!I have the larger model of this (Tower TCH7090ERD) for my house, so I decided to try the smaller model for my office.It has the SAME features but smaller, which is PERFECT.There\'s a remote control. It oscilates. There\'s an eco function (to help conserve energy). There\'s a timer to shut off AND turn on the space heater. There\'s an auto-off function if the heater tips over. There\'s an LED screen with the temperature and reads ""eco"" if the eco funtion is on/off. It\'s quiet. The heat can be HOT, which is nice! There are different modes which can turn on only the fan (no heat), eco/non-eco, and a non-freeze mode (maintains an area at a low temperature that\'s above freezing but not warm, used in rooms that are seldom inhabited or empty).I read LOTS of revies before purchasing this space heater and its larger model because I had a bad experience with a space heater a long time ago that nearly set my house on fire :( Since then, I\'ve avoided space heaters until these 2 models :) I anticipate that these will last a LONG time :) After they stop working, I\'ll probably stick to this brand/model :)VERY happy customer.', 'Real junk right out of the box.Hassle to return to Best buy.', 'The product may well be a very good piece of equipment ,but, it will not work on 240volts which is standard in the U.K. I believe that in order not to mislead customers you should specify the voltage of your equipment in your advertisement. I would then not wasted my money buying your 120volts heater.', 'great heater', 'GREAT', 'The heater is loud when it is on.   The fan is not strong.  The unit is not as good as what I thought.  Overall, I am unsatisfied with the unit all all.  I have a mini desk fan tower bought from costco.  It works good and quiet.']","Used: An item that has been used previously.

Comfort Zone CZ798BK Milkhouse Utility Heater with Steel Body,38.0, ,"[""While the product appears to be well-made, the utterly anemic airflow from the under-powered 2-blade fan means that only things within about 2 3' are going to actually get warm anytime soon after turning this thing on, even at the highest setting.  As a fan, it is a complete joke. The much smaller heater that died and that this one replaced put out at least twice as much useful heat, moved a lot more air, and would project it a solid 6' or more!  This heater is nice-looking, sort-of, if you like louvers, but is functionally inferior relative to it's size and stated wattage.  Thankfully, the bathroom I bought it for is very small and it is almost enough to do the job of warming the room during a shower, even if it isn't up to the task of warming up any significantly-sized space or room, such as a bedroom, unless left to run for an hour or more. I will not be buying another one like this."", ""What can you expect from any heater?Heat and easy to use, PLUS GOOD PRICE.With that said, WHY would you buy a plasticCase heater. It it gets too hot? IT MELTS.So they really control output. With a metal case heater. They control QAULITY. Much much better heat output, made to last more than 1 year. This will be my 7 th metal heater in 20 years. The company that made them. Replaced 4 of them FREE AND SHIPPING.when you find something that's last,price,material made. You would to stick with it. RIGHT?.  With that said !!! I WILL NEVER BY A PLASTIC HEATER. !!!!!"", 'What a great little unit for a great little price. Love the ability to switch to low wattage. Easy on the generator heated the room quickly great quality', 'Control knobs are difficult to manipulate. Very tight so not recommended for anyone with arthritis. Other than that, this is a well designed and effective item. Would be much better if the knobs had some kind of wings or tabs on them.', ""I like this type of heater. They heat the house well. It's not cold enough yet to turn the pellet stove on so I use these and they keep the house at a comfortable temperature."", ""I use it as supplemental heat in an RV with thin walls. It does pretty well. It's not the most well built heater I've ever had and I had to tighten all the screws to keep it from being noisy (frequency of the fan made it vibrate a bit), but it heats well enough and the fan is pretty powerful.  It is louder than most though, but acceptable."", 'This heater works great.  Very quiet.  Very happy.  Highly recommend.', 'very good room heater, thermostat control for room comfort. it will actually keep 2 rooms warm, looks good operates easy keeps me warm.', 'i like that you can adjust between 1300 and 1500 watts and also has a adjustable thermostat. The fan is not very strong and wish it blew a little harder', 'Pro: Sturdy and puts out the heat. Con: Hard to dial in to one temp range. One morning I was cold and it stopped coming on.

Lasko 5307 Portable Electric 1500W Room Oscillating Ceramic Tower Space Heater,37.25,30-day returns,"['I live in Oakland, California in the USA. The usual temperature here during winter nights goes between 35 to 40 something degrees Fahrenheit. I use it to warm up a small room (10 feet x 10 feet x 8 feet, without insulation). I usually turn it on with maximum temperature and speed for around 20 minutes. The room would be heat up to reasonably warm. Usually, I could turn the heater off for about half an hour before I need to turn it on again.', 'Great small room space heater.  Simple controls.  Quiet but not so quiet you forget and leave it on.  Only wish I knew heating watts on the low heat setting.  Have not put the thermostat into use yet...maybe try to use it/get the heater cycling at some warm bathroom temperature in the winter.', ""This unit is closely-related to the one (same brand &amp; features) I've been using these past 5+ years.  A reliable workhorse, with a bonus: It turns into a no-heat fan in the summer!!  Fits compactly under my desk."", 'This little heater has amazing power. It is small . I use it on a medium setting and it heats a very large area. No need to turn it all the way up. I’m very happy with this heater.', ""I've had many space heaters over the years, but this one is a gem: a high-quality product that works well and quickly. It's the quietest heater I've ever had. The oscillating heating tower guarantees the whole room gets warm. The tower design is sleek, and the whole unit takes up little space. This machine has heft and seems well made. Though it's about 3-times taller than it is wide, most of the weight is in the base, which makes it feel solid and not prone to tipping over easily. I'm so in love with this baby that I'm buying a second -- FOR MY 3-ROOM APARTMENT!! lolI wholeheartedly recommend this product."", ""Received this tower fan and it's very sturdy, has several settings: air, low heat and higher heat. Large enough to heat a medium sized room; only complaint is it smells a bit antiseptic."", 'I have not actually used my LASKO 5370 Ceramic/ Oscillating Heater yet. I purchased the LASKO Name. Have always had longevity with their products. I highly recommend.', ""Very appropriate for heating a small space - generates desired heat; good price and good design...would have been rated a '5 star' if it has an auto shut off when desired room temp is reached."", 'This product works well, is easy to move around to different locations, and keeps me cozy when I am chilled.  I would recommend it to others!  ', ""Almost bought the more expensive model because it came with a remote. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and found one in here! Remote doesn't come with batteries though, so have AAAs handy.<br&gt;It's relatively quiet, heats up the room quickly, and the thermostat works pretty well.

"Lasko 755320 Ceramic Space Tower Heater, 8.5″L x 7.25″W x 23″H, Silver",39.02, ,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit. The Oscillation can be Set by The Remote as well. PROS: Great Designed Unit.

However, the case doesn't get hot, so I'm not really to concerned  I used mine to blow heat under my bed when it's cold, it's small enough that it sets below my box springs, so it's not blowing on the bed but under it.

I use it for my feet but if it\'s really cold in the space that it\'s being used in, it wouldn\'t be enough heat to be effective even for something like feet.The only reason I bought this one is because my previous order for the same heater was cancelled by \tXA-ELECTRONICS.  First they sent me an email that they were refunding my money with no explanation then later an email arrived saying the reason for the cancelled transaction was that ""The seller says that both of you disagreed over the terms of the transaction"".  This is completely untrue because I had nothing to say about it, so it was just a complete waste of time for me and I still have no idea why they cancelled it without any explanation.  i tried to contact them about this but haven\'t received a response.I would definitely support JONI-MARKET for their extremely fast shipping and excellent service but unless you want a lot of games with extremely poor communication I would avoid like the plague XA-ELECTRONICS for any purchases.', ""When I received this...

Heater Electric Oscillating Radiant Dish Adjustable Tilt Black Comfort Zone,35.03,Money Back Guarantee,"['Decent Performance but no where close to a Presto Heat Dish.. I bought this model in my rebellion against the high cost of a Presto replacement. It does have a couple of cool features we enjoy. Hi/Lo switch and it tilts forward or back for better heat aim', ""After the initial break-in time which is one or two days the heater is very enjoyable. Some lubricant used in manufacturing has to burn off during that time and it has a very strong odor. The best thing about this heater is that it is quiet! I appreciate the two different temperature settings, the low temperature setting being a little bit higher than other models similar to this - which is a good thing. My ceramic heaters which have a fan, work well but are just too noisy at night. The glow, when it is on high can take some getting used to when you're sleeping, but if you have it on low and it is closer to you, you feel the heat without the distraction of the light.  And finally, the heat is the type that heats YOU , and goes into your bones - like the feel of sunlight - pretty good. It Heats objects much more so than the air. "", 'Works well. Heats quickly and oscillates smoothly. Two heat setting. Wanted it to heat a small bathroon space - it does.', ""Unless you're in a closet, there is not enough wattage for this heater to do any good. I replaced an older model that was built much better (metal), and worked just as well with 700 watts verses the 1000 watts this model is supposed to use. Things aren't made well anymore in almost any category, this being just one of them."", ""When it oscillates, it makes some noise &amp; it's very annoying , so I just set it  on  the still mode. That's why I rated it as 3 stars because of the noise.   It keeps me warmer  better   when  I  set it  on the still mode  because  it concentrates the heat where it's directed. I  usually set it to the low setting  which is  700 watts  for energy savings ."", 'I am enjoying all the heat this puts out on low. Heats entire 325 sqft of the motorhome. Thank you', 'Plenty of radiant heat. Works Great in our tent when camping.', 'there is a very cold room in my room, this electric heater help to keep it warm! love it!', 'Two of these heaters on low setting provide 95% of the heat in winter season to keep us comfortable in our 1525 sq, ft home.
