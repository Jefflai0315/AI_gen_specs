DeLonghi HMP1500 Mica Panel Space Heater,99.99, ,"[""I like this heater a lot. I bought two of them. One I've mounted on my bedroom wall. The other I left on its wheels so I can move it around the house. And it does have a very comfortable recessed carrying handle. It does give off an offensive odor at the beginning, so I recommend placing it outside, running, for 3-4 hours and that should burn off the smell. It's very, very quiet but not totally silent. I has a slight audible hum, which I thought would bother me at first, but I've easily adjusted to it. In fact, I learned to find it comforting, like white noise. I find listening to its slight hum and feeling its warming comfort actually induces me to go to sleep. It's a radiant heater, but unlike the older type radiant heaters, it doesn't cook you. It has two settings. On Minimum (800 watts), only the top one third of the heater heats up. On Max (1500 watts), the entire heater heats up. It can heat up my 10' by 10' bedroom on a very cold day (around 32 degrees) within in an hour.  The only fault that I've found with this heater is that the automatic shut off alarm can kick in too soon, before the it's completed its job, but that happens only on Max. Otherwise, once I warm up my bedroom, I can run it on Minimum all night with no disturbing alarm. I've put it on a remote controlled timer switch that can be set to shut off at intervals of 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, or longer. I do this to save electricity. Just be sure the timer you buy can handle more than 1500 watts. At the same time, it's also plugged into a remote controlled thermostat (available on eBay). I set the heater's thermostat to its highest setting, and let the remote thermostat control when the heater comes on and off."", 'warms quickly, feels healthy, large surface heat area. best heater so far. thanks', ""I came to the conclusion that this heater would be a good pick for a bedroom. I ended up purchasing this DeLonghi Mica Panel Heater for the bedroom. The reason I chose this brand over other mica panels is due to my experience with their products in the past. I've owned a DeLonghi Radiator Heater which has worked just as great. If you dont know much about DeLonghi, they are a European-based company that makes quality appliances, specifically utilizing German-engineering."", 'I bought this heater to replace my oil filled radiator which stopped working. It is for a 12 foot by 12 foot bedroom. The old radiator heated the room comfortably but took a while to get up to heat. This new heater is more powerful and heats up quicker even though it is a 1500w heater just like the radiator was. Highly recommend for average sized rooms!', 'This is the best heater I’ve ever used . With it anchored to wall much safer than most .', 'if you want a quite heater that will do the job over time even in a large under insulated areas this is your heater. remember it is a convection heater and may take time to bring the room up to desired temperature but this one really puts out the heat, great quality and modern looks I like you can mount on wall and none of the exposed areas will burn you.', 'Before use you should put outdoors and put it on max so the smell will burn off.  Happened indoors and was not a good thing.  It heats very well and is very quiet.', ""Quiet.  Heats a room or my livingroom-diningroom-kitchen stretch with a heat that actually feels warm.  I have it on the lowest setting to do that.  Keep the thermostat at 60 and move the heater around to the main area of the house in the day and to the bedroom at night and don't need to heat the whole house all the time with the gas heat. Wish it had a handle on top to move it when it is warm.  Casters are plastic so we'll see how long that lasts but I am careful with my things."", 'We had a prior model and just love this one.

NEW Opened Boxed Presto Heat Dish Plus Parabolic Electric Heater RADIATION 1000W,99.99, ,"[""I use this heater in my clinic and my patients absolutely love it. It's amazing how quickly it heats a room without air blasting or noise. It has a nice safety feature where it makes a horrible noise if it's tipping over (it only happens if I'm moving it when it's on). In fact several of my patients have gone out and bought their own for home. I should get a commission."", 'I have an old 1911 craftsman style house with no insulation.  My heating system is an outdated oil furnace.  As we all know the price of fuel is always fluctuating and seems like it is going to stay that way.  It costs me about $300.00 a month in the winter.  Which is ridiculous, especially when the heat just does not stay in the house for long.I needed a knew plan and changing out the heat system or insulating the house is not an option at this time.  So I went out and bought the presto heatdish.  It produces so much heat that during the winter I no longer had to heat the entire house to stay warm.  I would just carry the heatdish around with me, saving me hundreds of dollars month to month.  I had a few other electric heaters before I purchased this one and the difference is night and day.I  have had this heater for almost 3 years now and it still works as well as the day I purchased it.  It paid for itself in its first week work.  With as much use as this gets I would of expected it to burn out a while ago, but that is not the case.The drawbacks: It does not have an automatic turn off system if it were to fall over, but it does have an alarm that is unmistakably loud.   There is also a footlight that you cannot turn off or on, but you can just take out the lightbulb if that bothers you.Great product and highly recommended. Thanks for reading.', ""Proven, ancient technology that outperforms the daylights of newer, highly rated products. It's effective (heats the room quickly and thoroughly), efficient (only 1,000 watts), safe (automatic shut-off features), and built to last. Sometimes a product cannot be improved upon.  "", 'It gives off a good amount of heat but it has one big design flaw where the dish can not be tilted. This means the dish is in a fixed position which points into the air slightly. So if the surface you place it on is taller than you are while seated you will struggle to feel it. The safety tip over buzzer also prevents you from sliding something underneath it to tilt it yourself.', ""This is a wonderful heater.  I am a smoker and visit my family a lot.  I choose to smoke in the garage there and my sister in law bought this for me to use in the garage. It warms up quickly for the immediate area and it doesn't take long for the surrounding areas to warm up either. Once this gets going I don't even need a coat.  (Ohio area)  I have a house with very tall ceilings in the master bedroom and living area.  In the winter this little heater warms up quickly, even going right to the high setting.  I always have to turn it way back too.  I am widowed now and I don't need to keep the entire house warm, just where I am.  I do recommend this.  Oh, it is safe, if you move it at all when it is on you get a loud buzz sound!  If on the fence about it I would go with it."", 'Great price, lightweight, energy efficient. It has worked very well so far. The price was the best I found on Ebay. I think the design is very good. The shape of the dish plus the shiny interior helps it be much more efficient than a regular space heater. It gets very hot very fast. It also has a buzzer in case it tips over. A great all around heater to warm a person up fast.', ""These are fabulous heaters (radiant warmth, like the sun) and are in great condition.At first they didn't quite meet my needs, because I needed them to point straight ahead, whereas they are angled slightly upward and this is not adjustable. However, I set each heater on a slanted platform (which I made out of heavy cardboard), and now they meet my needs perfectly. (Parabolic heat dish heaters warm whatever is directly in front of them, within about, say, 15 feet.) You won't believe how much glowing warmth they put out!Also, Rob was great to do business with."", ""I live in a 1920's craftsman style house with poor insulation. This heater is wonderful and has allowed me to turn my thermostat down several degrees and still be comfortable here in Minnesota. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could because it is actually a little bit large to walk around in a small house with small rooms.  But that said, even set as low as it will go, it still puts out a lot of heat. In fact, I have to be careful not to put it in a room near my thermostat because the furnace will not come on at all if I do!  I have already recommended it to friends."", 'This heat dish pumps out heat so intensely it’s like a dryer for your cloths if sitting in front of it. I could feel it’s radiant heat from about 15ft away. Wayyyy better than other heat dish I had no contest. It does not oscillate and no remote only 2 features not on this probably because it is heavy duty. This is the best heat dish, look no further. ', ""I had a socially distanced bourbon tasting party for four on my back patio during January 2021 in Chicago. My neighbor had two of the Presto dishes so I ordered two more. Even though the evening's temperature dipped into the mid-20s, all four of us were completely comfortable sitting in our patio chairs with a our own Presto dish to keep us warm.

Lasko Electric Tower Space Heater Portable Digital Remote Control 1500-Watt,98.59,30-day returns,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater. And If I have to replace any one of the heaters I have, it will be with a Lasko 5572 heater.HJ of Missouri', ""We were absolutely thrilled with the size and capability of this room heater.

The other heater's slot is angled so your fingers don't slip out.  The one remote does control either heater.  I recommended my satisfaction to a friend and he bought one and is happy with it.

Lasko 5572 Portable Electric 1500W Room Oscillating Ceramic Tower Space Heater,96.60,54 sold,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater. And If I have to replace any one of the heaters I have, it will be with a Lasko 5572 heater.HJ of Missouri', ""We were absolutely thrilled with the size and capability of this room heater.  It's a little taller than the other Lasko portable heater and our decision to get it was a good one. For our needs, this one is perfect. "", 'I really enjoy my heater.  I live in Arizona where it is getting cooler at night now.  It is very efficient and quiet.', 'Heats small area immediately in the morning, with an increase of 5-10 degrees in temperature within 15 minutes.  Easy to operate, with remote.

I bought the second one because one of our tenants lost the remote.  One is #5165, the other one is #755320, the only complaint I have on this model is I had to stick a piece of foam tale on the top of the carrying slot in back so my finger wouldn't slip out of the carrying slot when carrying the heater.  The other heater's slot is angled so your fingers don't slip out.  The one remote does control either heater.  I recommended my satisfaction to a friend and he bought one and is happy with it.

Keeps my whole RV toasty warm. I would recommend by a large propane tank to refill the 1 pound tanks. Much cheaper. But I’ve not been cold once. The safety feature of turning off it it tilts is great. Only problem I have found is the bottom piece you place on propane tank does not secure properly and falls off when lifted off the ground to move the heater. ', 'This little buddy heater is a fine unit for use in an ice fishing shelter or flip over sled / tent. It is the right size and has a small footprint.The angle of the head heating element is perfect for warming wet hands and can be easily aimed to direct the heater output.The only down side is that it can be difficult to light in even the slightest breeze.', ""This is just the right amount of heat and size  for my needs compared to the regular Mr. Heater but does not hold up to heavy use. Have had a regular size that I use in an icefishing house that has years of use on it. The little buddies I've had are lucky to make an ice season before getting had to light and the just quitting. Love the little buddies while they work but the regular Mr buddy is a much better long term value."", 'I bought this to heat my ice fishing hut and only used it a handful of times. Looks like it’s made pretty durable, the igniter works good, like the carry handle, the metal shield cools down pretty quick if you want to move spots. The negatives are the sensor for the automatic shut off is way too sensitive, if you dont have it pretty close to PERFECTLY flat it goes out which is a pain. Also there is no heat control so once it’s first lit it’s just barely staying lit, can’t have any wind blow on it or it goes out, plus once the honeycomb section is lit well finally and red it’s burning propane at such a low rate heat does not blow out of it, it only rises from it. I guess the plus to that is low propane consumption but it would be nice to be able to crank it up if you want to blow some heat at you. This is a new school version of a metal coffee can with a roll of toilet paper inside soaked in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol. ', ""These things do a good job of heating my small fish house, but it does not take long and they get hard to light and won't work Have gone through three in three ice fishing seasons.. The regular size Mr. Heater is more reliable and I should probably just stick with those but the smaller size and a bit less btu's just works better in my tiny and very well insulated fish house.Have tried the cleaning method described in the manual but it is very hard to take apart and nothing seems to help."", 'Bought 3 fir use to heat bedrooms in the house during power outages.

It seems to be the best match available of heat output needed for my collapsible fish house."", ""I used this in my motorhome to keep the chill off at night and not have to use the furnace, which runs the batteries down significantly while boon-docking. It will run for 6 hours on one propane bottle, so it will not last all night. However, if you start it at midnight, it will run until 6 AM, at which time you can turn on your furnace for a short time if you're an early riser.

 Lasko Electric Portable Ceramic Tower Heater 1500 Watt w/ Logic Center Remote,96.89,Last item available,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater. And If I have to replace any one of the heaters I have, it will be with a Lasko 5572 heater.HJ of Missouri', ""We were absolutely thrilled with the size and capability of this room heater.  It's a little taller than the other Lasko portable heater and our decision to get it was a good one. For our needs, this one is perfect. "", 'I really enjoy my heater.  I live in Arizona where it is getting cooler at night now.  It is very efficient and quiet.', 'Heats small area immediately in the morning, with an increase of 5-10 degrees in temperature within 15 minutes.  Easy to operate, with remote.  As usual: follow directions in the manufacturers manual for best results!', ""Wow, does this put out some heat, and like now..  Don't have to wait for anything to warm up  immediate heat..  2 modes low 900w and high 1500w..  Plus you can set it from 39 degrees to 90 degrees and to kick on automatically if room gets below set temp..  This can almost heat my whole house..  Will prob heat at least 3 rooms.Led readouts are bright and clear, fan, remote, oscillates, has real buttons, not plastic film that will wear out, and stands tall.  Has handle for easy moving.. With gas prices doubling this winter, I'm turning to a space heater so I can lower the thermostat.. "", 'great heater, used it all winter, no problems, good price, fast delivery', ""I don't have this exact model, but I have two similar Lesco 1500w heaters w/digital displays w/remotes.  I bought the second one because one of our tenants lost the remote.  One is #5165, the other one is #755320, the only complaint I have on this model is I had to stick a piece of foam tale on the top of the carrying slot in back so my finger wouldn't slip out of the carrying slot when carrying the heater.  The other heater's slot is angled so your fingers don't slip out.  The one remote does control either heater.  I recommended my satisfaction to a friend and he bought one and is happy with it.  I don't know his model #. I've had the first hater 5 yrs and the second one 2 yrs and both work great."", ""Great heater. Warms my garage better than expected.

Air Heater Forced Kerosene Portable Indoor Outdoor Temperature Control Open Box,99.0, ,"['Works great!  My only concern is the electronics.  It is replacing a much simpler unit that has lasted for over 20 years.  Hopefully this one will outlast me. ', ""This item's predecessor was a 80K BTU Reddy Heat model that lasted 15 years until I ran over it with my UTV. They're well built and tough, but not THAT tough. The Dyna Glo Delux is identical to the Reddy Heat model in performance with improved controls and safety features. This is an absolute essential item when living in a area where temperatures hover around freezing and frequently dip below zero degrees. I love the multi-fuel capabilities too. "", 'I have only had it for a few weeks now. I used it 5 or 6 times. Filled it with kerosene, plugged in, flipped the switch, bam, heat! Starts up easy and fast, no smoke, shuts off when it reaches temp. Kicks on when it drops down. Its a one car garage I use to work on machinery and it works great. I hope it lasts.', 'I bought the heater to heat my small shop in my basement. Assembly was simple. I fueled up with K1 kerosene and plugged it in. I set the thermostat, cracked the basement door and fired it up. My shop was warm enough to work in within 5 mins. I actually had to turn the thermostat down a bit because it became too warm. I ran it for about 90 mins and used up very little of the fuel. The heater does the job for me and is very simple to use. Just remember this unit produces CO so be sure to have a fresh air supply like opening a door nearby.', 'I am amazed how quickly this heats up my newly built uninsulated 32x52 (1664 sq ft ) shop even on the coldest of days! Once I achieve the temperature I want, the thermostat control maintains it for me very well allowing me to work on finishing the interior.

This fit the old opening in the ceiling perfectly and the wiring was the exact same so installation was relatively easy. The ventilator fan is much quieter on this model.', 'I purchased this for the internal parts to replace in an existing unit that failed although they were slightly different I managed to make them work. A good thing because the lens was scratched from shipping and I didn’t need it so didn’t need to return it. It all worked out fine.', ""Is a great exhaust fan.  A bit noise but you feel the draft.  My wall mirror used to steam up.  With this exhaust fan is just clear all the time.  I have it in a full small bath and works great.   I had trouble putting this one up.  It would't fit unless i force the case in the opening by sheetrock cutting in.   Which I just white glued it all around and seal the opening and looked great.  housing hums a bit, but seems to lower now that it's been set.   I hear more the air draft exhausting more than the hum.  I will be insulating the hum at later time. The light mount iluminates inside and the room very well.  I put an LED bulb and works great.   I couldn't figure it out why the base/box bigger than the fan. Must be in creating more draft.  After the tough time installing it. Very Very Very happy with it.  The price  a bit to much!!!"", 'Product quality average.  Not as good as original 665.  Individual parts NOT interchangeable.  To replace original 665 would have to rip out a good size piece of drywall and then repair or change out from attic.', 'This newer model was larger than the old NuTone 665, and the internal parts were different, but the install was very similar.  The old Fan lasted over 25 years, and I am hoping that this new one lasts just as long.  In my old fan, the heater and light still worked, but it was virtually impossible to find a new vent motor that would fit the old unit, so I just bought the new model.  If history is any indication, it is money well spent.', 'It was very easy to pull fan and heater from this kit and replace in same home fan assembly that failed.  Took me less than 15 minutes to swap out parts.  Would purchase replacement parts again based on ease of removal and assembly.  Very nice design for replacement of parts.  Durability maybe different issue.

MR HEATER MH9BX Mr Heater 4K - 9K BTU Portable Buddy Heater,97.69,30-day returns,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Some lubricant used in manufacturing has to burn off during that time and it has a very strong odor. The best thing about this heater is that it is quiet! I appreciate the two different temperature settings, the low temperature setting being a little bit higher than other models similar to this - which is a good thing. My ceramic heaters which have a fan, work well but are just too noisy at night. The glow, when it is on high can take some getting used to when you're sleeping, but if you have it on low and it is closer to you, you feel the heat without the distraction of the light.

If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly.

It's below freezing outside and this unit cycles and maintains 63-68 degrees with a 72 degree setting. The area is an insulated 900 sqft and the temperature is read on the wall furthest from the unit. Until I get a better primary heat source this is a great unit to have till then."", ""The heater is built pretty tough, which is a good thing. I also found it easy to connect, which interestingly enough was more expensive for the materials than it was for the heater. Only problem is that it doesn't heat as well as advertised. It claimed to heat an area (uninsulated) that was 30x30. my garage is 25x35 so I figured that was basically the same thing. after running for an hour or more it only brought the temp up from 45* to about 52*. I guess that if I left it running all the time it would eventually gey there, but that was not what I was hoping for. Plus, those temps were only for the emediate area around the heater, the far end of the garage was still ice cold. In any account it is a good heater for the price. especially if you already have a place wired for it."", ""Havent used it yet, but looks nice. It's smaller than I thought but as long as it heats good then I'm ok with it. I was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the plug. Luckily I have an extra one. I will have it hooked up in a couple of days. Thanks. "", ""Installed in my 2 car garage, used the correct 8ga wire and double pole breaker. On high setting, it trips the breaker. Tried a different breaker, no luck. It doesn't heat the garage as well as I anticipated, but better than having no heater at all. I like the remote, it works well. Heater is quiet. Not impressed but whatever. I may end up moving it to my basement, where I believe it may work better. "", 'After researching different heater I found this to be the best deal, but the heat sensor is on the inside witch makes it shut off sooner than it should so I located it on the outside and it now works good. I also looked on youtube to see how to hook up 220w and found it to be really easy but make sure you use 8/3 wire and a 40amp double pull breaker for safety reasons. I have a 24x30 insulated garage with 8 foot ceilings and at 32 degrees it will heat up at about 10 degrees an hour and after a while when the heat is up a little bit it seems to heat up faster so I use my kerosene heater to speed things up a little and when it gets around 68 degrees this heater can maintain very easy. now just so you know I have 4 metal cars in my garage that retain cold air for quite a while so your garage might heat up faster depending what you have in it', ""I purchased this unit to replace my old one. The unit arrived very quickly. I think it took 4 days to get to me. Packaging was very stout, no damage to the unit. I did have a friend of mine help me install it but it wasn't really hard and could have done it in a pinch. Instructions were easy to read. I have a 25x25 sq ft shop, insulated to about R4 and this heater does a nice job of warming it with outside temps around around 32F. This unit is also nice in that I have a choice of hi or lo elements used to heat.I would recommend this and install it myself if I go to a larger building."", 'Great price, great size, easy to use', ""Not happy with this heater. First of all, the thermostat is not correct, as it is located INSIDE the heater where it stays hot. Must be set much much higher for desired temp. Second, and worst of all, when the heater switches ON or OFF, it makes a extremely loud BANG. Really disappointing for the price and would return it if it wasn't hard wired in. Regret buying the warranty, as I don't plan on keeping past it's first breakdown."", 'The temperature sensor is mounted in a way that the heater cuts off way before room temperature is reached.  Believe the sensor is getting reading from the case rather than ambient temperature.  ', 'Well Made. Easy to use. Shipping was fast, with damage. Easy to install. Easy to hang. Would highly recommend it if the square footage is right and it is insulated.']","For parts or not working: An item that does not function as intended and is not fully operational.

It’ll keep me nice and toasty this winter since my steam radiator barely works in my apartment!  ', ""I bought this heater to use to warm a living room with vaulted ceilings. It has a cool LED flame effect that can be used alone or in conjunction with heat.  I find that the lowest setting is more than adequate for keeping the living room warm. The only thing that could be better would be if it had a thermostat. Otherwise it's pretty much perfect.  The fan is silent and I have to get next to it to barely hear it running.

Lasko 755320 Ceramic Space Tower Heater 8.5″L x 7.25″W x 23″H Silver,98.16, ,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit. The Oscillation can be Set by The Remote as well. PROS: Great Designed Unit.

Mr. Heater Radiant Propane Portable Heater 9000 BTU Tip-Over Safety Switch Steel,96.12,30-day returns,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank.

Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.

I keep it close to where I use it so no need form the remote though that is a good extra. Also has a built in timer as well. Great little unit for the money!

It has served its purpose for the past 3 years. I have run it on Hi - 70 degrees to do this, and it has worked well.   It keeps the electric bill down, plus all my recreational toys safe from the freezing temperatures during the winter.  Of course, I follow all of the safety recommendations that include nothing around it for 3ft.  It is dependable, and does the job.  I would recommend this model over all of the no-name models, as PELONIS is an american company who designs their equipment themselves, and ensures that everything is built tough with good materials.', 'My Mom loves it  placed in her bedroomset the controls and slept the night away.easy to assembly and work.  just setthe temp, time and relax the night away.jealous hers has a remote', 'Great Value !!!,... timer set on and off times,... remote control !!!! buy this!!!!save money on utility bills 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻', ""I love this heater .

Lasko 755320 Ceramic Space Heater 8.5 L x 7.25 W x 23 H inches 2 Quiet Settings,96.95, ,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit. The Oscillation can be Set by The Remote as well. PROS: Great Designed Unit.

Comfort Zone CZQTV5M Quartz Electric Wall Mount Heater - Black,96.91, ,"['I already had one of these so I knew what I was getting.  There was a problem with both units.  The arm that attaches to the sides was installed backwards.  In other words, it was in front of the heating element.  They have about a 90 degree tuning angle.  It had to be taken apart and the base arms rotated 180 degree so the bracket would actually be behind the unit (like the picture shows).  Luckily, I am handy enough to do that.  The units work great but draw a lot of power.  At 1500 watts, a standard house breaker can only handle 2 (if you are lucky) with nothing else turned on. Running 3 units on the 750 watt setting is the best you can ask for.', 'Heater appears to be flimsy and cheaply made. That being said, it seems to work fine. But I have not used it a lot.  Makes me wonder how long it will continue to work.  But for the price, I can not complain. It does its job.  This is a very inexpensive heater.  It is important to have it pointed in the correct direction since it heats surfaces and I am the surface wanting to be heater. I would have liked it better if it could have been angled better, but it seems to have built in tilting restrictions.  The included LED light is cheap, very dim, and close to worthless.  But on the whole I am still happy.  Would I buy it again?  Depends on its longevity. If it lasts more than 3 years, yes.', 'It is well made, the price is a little excessive. It heats well, but only good for a small area. You can mount it several different ways, which is a plus.', ""I have used this type heater in my home shop for the last 15 years and it has done a great job. This past summer I built a 12' X 12' gazebo and I enclosed it for the winter so the kids can use it for a play house and still we cook in there with a electric grill. Since I have used this type heater for several years I decided to buy one for the gazebo and I am glad I did, it does a great job and it was a very good price."", 'Pros, heats well and radiates s good 10 feet plus,  two heat ranges 750 and 1500 watts, pull cord is perfect length for rafter mounting, power cord is long and high quality.    Cons, halogen light is bright and annoying but does not light up any significant space in the room, bracket system is ultra flimsy. Bracket assembly is ratcheted and only goes in one direction. You will break it unless your one in a million that reads bad language Chinese instructions, halogen bulb burns out frequently, are near impossible to find, and cost 8 dollars each.

"Mr. Heater MH9BX 9000 BTU Propane Portable Buddy Heater, MH9BX New!",99.0, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply.

"New Mr. Heater Little Buddy Portable Propane Heater, 3,800 BTU",95.95, ,"['Even though it cost almost 1 1/2 One Pound Coleman tanks from 9pm to 5am,  it’s great. Keeps my whole RV toasty warm. I would recommend by a large propane tank to refill the 1 pound tanks. Much cheaper. But I’ve not been cold once. The safety feature of turning off it it tilts is great. Only problem I have found is the bottom piece you place on propane tank does not secure properly and falls off when lifted off the ground to move the heater. ', 'This little buddy heater is a fine unit for use in an ice fishing shelter or flip over sled / tent. It is the right size and has a small footprint.The angle of the head heating element is perfect for warming wet hands and can be easily aimed to direct the heater output.The only down side is that it can be difficult to light in even the slightest breeze.', ""This is just the right amount of heat and size  for my needs compared to the regular Mr. Heater but does not hold up to heavy use. Have had a regular size that I use in an icefishing house that has years of use on it. The little buddies I've had are lucky to make an ice season before getting had to light and the just quitting. Love the little buddies while they work but the regular Mr buddy is a much better long term value."", 'I bought this to heat my ice fishing hut and only used it a handful of times. Looks like it’s made pretty durable, the igniter works good, like the carry handle, the metal shield cools down pretty quick if you want to move spots. The negatives are the sensor for the automatic shut off is way too sensitive, if you dont have it pretty close to PERFECTLY flat it goes out which is a pain. Also there is no heat control so once it’s first lit it’s just barely staying lit, can’t have any wind blow on it or it goes out, plus once the honeycomb section is lit well finally and red it’s burning propane at such a low rate heat does not blow out of it, it only rises from it. I guess the plus to that is low propane consumption but it would be nice to be able to crank it up if you want to blow some heat at you. This is a new school version of a metal coffee can with a roll of toilet paper inside soaked in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol. ', ""These things do a good job of heating my small fish house, but it does not take long and they get hard to light and won't work Have gone through three in three ice fishing seasons.. The regular size Mr. Heater is more reliable and I should probably just stick with those but the smaller size and a bit less btu's just works better in my tiny and very well insulated fish house.Have tried the cleaning method described in the manual but it is very hard to take apart and nothing seems to help."", 'Bought 3 fir use to heat bedrooms in the house during power outages.  Just arrived and a week later a planned one day power outage.  With new born baby, needed to ensure both mom and baby would stay warm.  Used the heater and it was fine.  ', ""I have the larger Mr. Heater for our sailboat works great! So I bought this for our RTT roof top tent ..works good don't get as hot which is good for a tent ,But! the base that holds the 1lb tank should be twice the size feels like it could fall over .I plan on fabricating a larger base :)                                                                        -=CC=-"", ""Not cheap. It is tippy with the 1 lb cylinder. I asked Mr Heater for a parts list to hard pipe it directly to a 5 lb or 20 lb cylinder and I got parts list for using a hose. I don't want to use a hose. I like that it is quiet. I like that you don't need matches. I wish it had more than 1 heat output setting. It seems to be the best match available of heat output needed for my collapsible fish house."", ""I used this in my motorhome to keep the chill off at night and not have to use the furnace, which runs the batteries down significantly while boon-docking. It will run for 6 hours on one propane bottle, so it will not last all night. However, if you start it at midnight, it will run until 6 AM, at which time you can turn on your furnace for a short time if you're an early riser. Alternatively, if you don't want to run the furnace in order to save batteries, you could light the burners on your stove. Be sure to crack a window so as not to deplete all the oxygen.

Tower 1500-Watt Electric Portable Ceramic Oscillating Space Heater with Digital ,99.02,30-day returns,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater.

Pelonis  space heater HO-0218  0706 Heater,95.0, ,"['I\'ve got two oil heaters in my house. I purchased this Pelonis model used. The other oil heater is a Lakewood that I purchased new. Both make a great supplement to the gas furnace that\'s designed to heat only one room of the house.This type of oil heater is pretty tough. They\'re not hard to find used and in good condition for around $20. You do, however, get what you pay for. This will heat a medium size bedroom so long as the windows are sealed properly. Mine doesn\'t have much control over the temperature, though. It seems to never be ""just right"". The 1500 watt Lakewood lacks the toe stubbing casters and does a better job of controlling the temperature.Still, though, if you find this heater used, it\'ll keep you warm.', ""I've only had it on for a few minutes, but it heated up.  Been warm and haven't needed.  I own another and it is great."", 'Outstanding product great value it works really really well.

I highly recommend this brand to all. Thank You.', 'better than forced air heaters in 1500w range.  creates even heat, less loss in heater.

Tower 1500-Watt Electric Portable Ceramic Oscillating Space Heater with Digital ,98.99, ,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element.

The other heater's slot is angled so your fingers don't slip out.  The one remote does control either heater.  I recommended my satisfaction to a friend and he bought one and is happy with it.

Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.

I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly.

It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time!

Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature.

It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable.

"Mr. Heater Buddy 4,000-9,000-BTU Indoor-Safe Portable Propane Radiant Heater",100.0, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank.

Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.
