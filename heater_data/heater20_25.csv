After two years, the Walmart hose split at the male connector end and began leaking propane and it was really stiff, especially in cold weather.

Lasko Digital Ceramic Heater 1500 Watts CC13700 * used * ,25.0, ,"['My Lasko CC13700 was manufactured Feb 2019 Purchased 11/11/19 from a local store. This was made in China where forced labor is documented but Lasko’s Social Responsibility statement addresses that issue: “Lasko and its affiliates will not work with any suppliers that engage in human trafficking and/or slavery.” The CC13700 seemed like it had an unusually strong odor new out of the box while it was heating. The heat was great but using it with the odor in the living area brought some unpleasant upper respiratory irritation and potential health issues that go along with that. After it aired out during the first year, the odor was not as noticeable in a well-ventilated area. At the end of the second season, it began to shut off immediately after turning on. It was under warranty so I sent an email to customer service and got a helpful reply the same evening. The suggestion of blowing air into the unit from the outside was a temporary fix for a few months but the heater eventually stopped blowing heat again so I submitted a warranty request. Due to the Lasko heater breakdown, I bought a new baseboard-style heater (without the chemical odor) before getting the replacement. Lasko Consumer Services stood behind the 3 year warranty. CC13700 was on back order and not available so they offered a different model. I did not have to pay return shipping and received a replacement fan heater within 15 days. It’s great to have to have a new Lasko fan heater, but it reintroduces the same indoor air pollution so I’m using this one away from the bedroom and main living areas to give it a year to air out. Regarding the CC13700 magnetic field, I checked it with a Triaxial ELF Magnetic Field Meter and found that the magnetic field from the motor was almost 48” in all directions, so I kept that in mind to maintain some distance while the heater was in use. The closed design with easy-vacuum filter is a nice innovation compared with open design fan heaters. Weekly filter vacuuming was essential to keep the plastic case cool and AC plug prongs from getting too hot in the outlet. I wish I could give the CC13700 more than 2 stars because it was excellent at putting out heat but apparently it wasn’t built to last. I think a heater should work for 5 years to earn a 5 star rating but this stopped working in less than 2 years. Fortunately there was a 3 year warranty and Lasko handled the warranty replacement very well (but the replacement heater deserves separate review because it is a different product and model number.) If the CC13700 could be repaired and used again, I would be open to editing the review with a higher rating because it was great before it stopped working. This was powerful and it produced instant hot air: I set Automatic Temperature Control about 15 degrees lower than expected to get the desired level of heat. (CC13700 digital temperature at the floor reads lower than other thermometers that I have and since heat rises, it might take several hours to raise floor temperature one degree in a small room, even with the door shut, while temperature 5 feet above the heater may be 10-20 degrees higher than what is shown on the display.) At first I didn’t like the CC13700 because it has an ergonomic design flaw that took awhile to get used to, in which placing the fingers under the carry handle makes it feel like it might be easy to tip over or drop. Regarding the digital controls: Pressing the red On button starts the heater on Hi setting. The 2 left buttons activate Automatic Temperature Control with digital setting range from 39F-90F (which must be set with the heater turned on and running). After selecting temperature, the DIGITAL DISPLAY FLASHES SEVERAL TIMES. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DO ANYTHING ELSE AT THAT POINT. Wait for the display to return to indicate the current room temperature and the Automatic Temperature Control should be set.  Automatic Temperature Control seems to have 3 degree temperature window which raises the temperature 2 degrees above the thermostat setting and drops one degree below before resuming operation. AC power interruption resets digital features to factory default. Pressing the middle timer button reveals 9 settings to set the timer between 1-8 hours or continuous. Adjustable louver control for directional heat is a nice feature made possible by the closed design.', 'Ordered 2 heaters,Wanted to send them back because they were way  to small,but I deceived to try them and boy do they heat up,I got so worm I had to kick off the blankets in the middle of the night.For such a small heater they generate a lot of heat.', 'High temp trips my 20 amp breaker. works fine on low', 'heat my bathroom very well love it', 'This product heats the interior of a 36 foot Avion 5th wheel RV when the outside temperature is &gt;30 degrees F.

Honeywell HCE100B Heat Bud Ceramic Heater Black Energy Efficient Space Saving,20.0, ,"[""What a load of rubbish.  I bought this item new in it's box.  I first unwound the electric cable added the adaptor and switched it on only for it to immediately blow up.  Thinking I may have made a mistake in the connectivity, and I really wanted one of these little heaters, I purchased a second identical item from the same source, and this also went bang in switching it on.  This even though I had bought new custom connector/converter for this item.  I am now a great many pounds out of pocket with nothing to show for my efforts."", ""This silent, compact heater has a feature to shut off if it's tipped.  It heats the confined area under my desk evenly.  Great product."", ""This was a small heater, with low wattage and an attractive price. I was  pleased to find out that it is made well and works great. I purchased a second small heater and it had fancier features than this one. However it died on me just two weeks after I purchased it. So I highly recommend this Honeywell heater for people needing a small heater for a camper or trailer. It heats well and at 600 watts, you can't lose. "", 'I bought this small heater mainly for my planned trip next Jan. Since auto heater comes very slow in the morning. I will use this heater with a inverter to speed up windshield defrost process because this electric heater will be instant on to do the job. ', ""It's small, convenient and warms you well."", 'Needed low wattage for off grid use in my little travel trailer. Perfect!!  Keeps my head and nose from getting too cold so i can save on propane use for heat.  Well made. Great value!!', 'It only takes a few minutes for the small heater to make my bathroom toasty. It’s of good quality and easy to use.', 'Had one before this, it heats up my small house I built for my outdoor cats, lasted allmost 3 months runing all the time before it died out. Pretty impressive for 20$.. heat is as expected for something of its size and power.', 'works well, 2 heat settings and auto off if it tips over. Would be nice if it had a ""thermostat"" to turn on &amp; off with a certain temp but for this price it\'s fantastic! It heats a nice 2-3\' ""bubble"" in the area immediately around it.', 'This was a great purchase for me. I used it under my desk during this last frigid blast, and it kept my feet nice and toasty.

When I was at graduate school, my friend used to have it for his room since that room used to be cold in our apartment. It used to work fine there, so I purchased for my room at my current apartment. ', ""I really haven't had to use it yet, for my apartment gets very warm because of the sun coming in on my windows which face west, but I did try it out and it is certainly easy to use."", 'This is an awesome heater for the price that I have paid.Pros:1. It can warm up the room quickly with different temperature setup2. It has the auto feature where it goes to sleep mode when the temperature in room reaches the set value and restarts whenever it goes lower beyond the set value3. It can oscillate like a tower fan and distribute the heat across the room4. Its light weightCons:1. It has the remote but during night you cant see the temperature that we have set on this humidifier. Having a display in the remote or on the humidifier itself', ""This is the second one I've purchased. The heater itself is a good value, and the oscillating feature, and remote control are an added bonus. Used my first purchase in my camper (2 years and still going strong). This one's for our home's enclosed porch."", ""I think the heater works well, But when you have a power outage you have to reset it to keep area warm. The controls don't allow it to pick up where, hear left off trying to heat area.   So that make this heater, not reliable for keeping kids warm, pets,  plants.  In the areas I have lived would even help prevent frozen water lines.  I makes heater like this only good for you if, your attending it.  If this heat had manual controls it would be better. or had a program to reboot and maintain a pre-set temp,  by factory or,  by the user.  Myself I like a electric  heater that works  as lone as I have power.  And  starts back up after a power outage.  Have a great day."", ""This heater doesn't oscillate on all the temperatures. Only oscillates from 75 and up."", 'Got this heater for my camp trailer. Might as well use a candle for heat.  . It would be fine if it had a fan inside it. Cant use it will look for something else that blows the heat out . Very disappointed !', 'I wish I could set temperature between 65 and 70, otherwise very good heater', ""What can you say, they are quite, thermostat adjustable, put out a tremendous amount of heat for their size, timered, remote control and oscillates.With out question best heaters that are portable I've ever owned."", 'When my other heater died I ordered the Lasko heater because I know that Lasko products are well made and have a good reputation. I am enjoying the heater in my some what cool basement music room. The features are great. With temperature control and timer. I could not ask for anything better.']","Used: An item that has been used previously. The item may have some signs of cosmetic wear, but is fully operational and functions as intended.

Lasko 101 White My Heat Personal Ceramic Heater New Open Box,21.97, ,"[""Have had both Eden Pure and Duraflame models used in my home. When comparing to the Dr. Infared DR-968, the most notable option that it lacks over the above mentioned is that you can not set run time for say, 3 hours or longer. This being a feature I believe, would make the DR-968 better. Honestly can't say how it will hold up as I've just recently purchased it. So far, it's doing the job at keeping my bedroom comfortable. It is being used as supplemental heat which helps keep my furnace from running non stop. It's size is smaller than the other two mentioned which is nice. I'm hopeful that it will provide long term use before heating elements give out as was the case with the other two models. Hope this review is of use to you."", 'using it to heat a small 5 x 5 entrance hall it heats it very good without using a lotof power', 'As others have said, it is small. But, at 200 watts, it was to be expected. It puts off enough heat to keep your legs warm under a desk, for example but would not heat an open area sufficiently. I purchased for my wife to use under her desk, and she likes it.', ""Very nice little electric heater, very small, quiet, only uses 200 watts, perfect for heating a small waiting room with outside walls and windows when it's 30s and up outside. Excellent value."", 'I bought this heater to heat a very small space, and I am surprised at how much heat it puts out.Temperatures here often reach well below zero, and I wanted a little heat in a room farthest from my wood stove.I like the construction as it seems to be quite sturdy.I also like the fan which circulates air out of the heater. I thought it was radiant heat only, but the fan inside moves the heat far beyond the heater.I do wish it had a control allowing for running at a lower power.  There is one switch only, for off and on. I wish it was thermostatically controlled, but for the price (under 20 dollars), it seems to be a good product.', ""Perfect heat for my home office.

Vornado VH203 Personal Heater & Gold-Compact Cool Touch Electric 750w,20.0, ,"[""This item is functional as a fan but the heater settings are not very hot.  The only real advantage of this item is that the lower electricity usage keeps the cord &amp; electric plug from becoming dangerously hot and melting your electric outlet (like with other heaters  1000W).  Other than that I can't really say much else about this item.  Since my bed area is just an open space in the men's dorm of my recuperative care shelter I have no idea if these machines can really circulate the air in a small enclosedspace.  I am glad to have two of them though because my bed is right under a vent duct in the ceiling and with the AC over functioning I get a lot of cold air blowing on me at all hours.  But I'm basically sleeping with the heaters in my bed on high because of the weaker heat settings.  Caveat empetor."", 'Great personal heater, fairly quiet (white noise, basically), perfect for a small space like on an office desk or while sitting on the sofa.  Not recommended for heating a larger room, but for personal use it can’t be beat.  Also very easy to move with you, unlike the tower style heaters that are very common in the market.  It has a lower setting too, which can come in handy because in a small setting (on the sofa), it can get you warmed up very quickly on high.', 'Nice heater for the money.

Handy Heater | Plug-In Personal Heater | Compact Design | Quick and Easy,24.97, ,"['I purchased this heater for a very specific purpose. I needed a small heater to dry out a wood window sill for a window located in a bathroom shower (long story). This heater satisfied all of my requirements which included: small enough to fit in the space between the storm window and double hung window, generate enough heat to dry the space without over heating, have a thermostat, and operate continuously for a prolonged period of time. I have not had any problems operating this unit on a heavy duty extension cord (not recommended in instructions). This unit will automatically turn on and off as it reaches the temperature you set for the unit. It produces just enough heat to satisfy my need. Criticisms regarding the 12 hour time limit can be resolved by plugging this unit into a timer. When the power is shut off and then back on, the unit will run again for 12 hours intervals solving the problem of having to be present to restart the unit. This unit must be suspended to prevent blockage of the air intake located on the bottom of the heater.', ""Quality feels good, not cheap. Plug rotation feature is secure and not wobbly or junky at all. Heater pulls 297 watts when running, but pulls ~750 watts for about 30 seconds when you turn it on from cold. This is a powerful little heater, you would not want to put your hand directly in front of it for very long. Definitely enough to heat a very small space like a car, or heat up a small room which isn't quite warm enough. Has a thermostat which works well. The heater will run the fan for a bit and cycle down just as it should. It has a red LED which always stays on and give the impression of a hot surface so that you don't forget that the grill could still be hot.The heater sucks air in from the bottom where the fan is.Honestly, this thing has better construction and features than most space heaters I've owned.Cannot yet speak to reliability but based on the good circuit design it should last quite a long time."", 'We have an L shaped bath room and the  baseboard heater is on the long side. On cold days the far corner of the short side gets cold.  This gadget is perfect, set temperature and  shave in comfort. easy to use, takes no space. I saved about  $1200 by not adding another baseboard floor heater when  a $12 heater is perfect.  Kudos to the designer for a great product !!Ol George', 'I wanted this for a very small seedling starter greenhouse but will be unable to use it as it shuts off after 12 hours.  Also when you turn it back on it starts at 90 degrees.  You have to reset the temp and timer every time you turn it back on.  I also bought one for my daughter to use in her tack room for two barn cats but she is also disappointed because of the 12 hour turn off feature.  Only useful if you are there to turn it back on and reset every 12 hours.', 'While this thinks key feature is size, It works well.  Unfortunately the the other plug in a two receptacle outlet cannot be used while this is plugged in.  It blocks the free receptacle partially enough to render it non-usable. It does produce some small fast heat to a rathed general localized area. Is it worth $20.00?  Yes if you will use often, no if you dont require the convenience of it.  Cheaper and more effective heaters are available, its really based on the buyers preference and intended use.  Works great for heating up bathroom when done with showering.  I would reccomend this if you find yourself seeing it  be applicable in a scenario.  ', 'This is a great heater for a small area.I plan on using it for a walk in closet that seems to not get heated very well.I can turn this little guy on for five minutes or so and the problem is solved', 'Better than i expected because the plug works both ways into the outlet, this is good 4 me cause all my outlets are upside down &amp; heater has timer , &amp; low &amp; high..  compact &amp; small, low price i really thinks thats great.  Thx.', 'I love the fact that these heaters have a ground connection.  The third pole helps stabilize the heater in the socket and keeps it from leaning and possibly falling out, like the socket heaters with only two poles.  They are great for a small room like a bathroom. ', ""It is very small but it put out some nice heat for it's size.  I like the thermostat feature so it goes off when it gets to that temperature.  "", 'I’ve given 5 of these as gifts. They are perfect for a bathroom or office or reading area. They are powerful but only heat a small area. Buy using it in the morning by my chair while I read the paper or file paperwork I do not have to turn up my furnace. I can pre heat a bathroom when it’s below zero outside and avoid freezing the second I step out of the shower!Not intended to warm large rooms.
