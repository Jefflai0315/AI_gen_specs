"Broan-NuTone Ceiling Heater 1,250-Watt Surface-Mount Fan-Forced",111.9,Last item available,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation. The power to the heater tested good.', ""Love this little heater, just renivating my Mum's home.   It's so nice to have this little heater in the basement bath.  Very reasonable in price and a nice touch!!!"", 'Brand new unused, unopened.  Excellent purchase. ', 'The Broan 157 ceiling heater is a great upgrade from the "" twisted wire element "" heater.

"Lifesmart 4 Element 1500W Portable Electric Infrared Quartz Space Heater, Indoor",114.99,243 sold,"['I have no problems with this unit.  The only thing, which is not bad, advertised that fan would run and not go off unless switched off in rear.  On mine, when the heater goes off, fan will run until the unit has cooled and then will go off.  Comes back on when the heater comes back on and gets warm.  This is not a problem, some might like it better that way, I just wish there was a switch to turn it off or on just for cool air circulation but, like I said, not a problem.  My heater in in the master bedroom, about 20 by 20, set it on 70 deg and feels really nice, do not have to run the reverse cycle air conditioner and heat the whole house.  Thought about buying another for the den, will run this one for about a month or so see if it keeps up the good work.  Jim in North Florida.', ""I purchased this heater in lieu of getting an EdenPure, because of its pricing.  The little fellow puts out good heat and looks very nice in my living room,  My remote control works great, even 20 feet away , or so.My main beef which has been mentioned before by others is that I do not think the thermometer in the heater is properly calibrated.  When I place the unit in Eco mode (which is supposed to try to keep the room as close as possible to 68 degrees, and is the most efficient setting) I too complain that I have walked into the room when the air temperature on a wall thermometer was 55 degrees Farenheit (and felt like it), and the heater is sitting on the floor, not running.  By the way, the floor is several degrees colder than up on the wall.The heater works best when in high, or low mode, with the temperature set by user.  I think the Eco setting is almost useless as advertised.So how could I recommend?  Because otherwise the heater seems to do fine, and really it costs next to nothing compared to an EdenPuke ( my parents have one which is such a disappointment).  C'mon guys, fix this little glitch and give me one with the fix that works because I described your product so honestly."", 'With default setting of 72 degree, unit keep shutting down with room temperature below 60 degree. Unit is very noisy when trying to heat up the room. Finally set temperature to 85 degree. At this temperature, unit was able to heat the small root to 65 in ~2 hours. The larger unit with fireplace work much better. Able to bring room temperature to 65 in less then 1 hour. Fan noise is much lower.', 'Wanted something for a little supplemental ""zone-type"" heat in different areas of our 2100 square foot home. The wife likes a temperature of around 65 and I like 70, so we leave the central heat set to 65 and this little heater goes in whichever room I\'m in whether it\'s the den, office or living room and does a fantastic job of bringing the extra comfort of heat wherever I put it. It\'s super quiet so you almost have to check the lights to see if it\'s operating. The remote function comes in real handy as long as you keep it close, I usually have to get up and find it  in the last room I came from.  Can\'t say how economical it is yet as I haven\'t had it long enough to compare the bill. All-in-all, I am satisfied and am considering a couple of these as Christmas gifts in the family. I hope this helps anybody looking at these and I am not a ""paid"" spokesperson. ;)', 'I have several of these units which I purchased from eBay.  They are of good quality and are very easy to use and the power savings are great.', 'This is my third brand of heater. The other two work great, so I thought I would buy this one based on its apperance and my satisfaction with the other two.  Now I have to contact the manufaturer to see if this unit is defective. Bummer deal when you buy something new.  Hopefully this can all be resolved quickly so I can enjoy it or purchase a different one.', 'Heating unit features are very nice,  controls on unit and remotes are easy to use.   Supplies heat and warm spaces as stated.', 'Have been using this type heater for several years but was pleasantly surprised when this turned out to be several inches shorter (front to back) than the ones I had been using. It fits in our space better than others and heats just as well. Also this heater was priced about half of the others.  Shipping was as promised..Received it in 3 days in good condition..', 'Great price, Nice size, Love the features and it functions as advertised.  Real wood exterior, a handy little portable heater that works great and heats up a surprisingly large area.

"Lifesmart 6 Element 1500W Portable Electric Infrared Quartz Space Heater, Indoor",114.99,30-day returns,"[""This heater worked awesome for about 4 months. I cleaned the filter regularly. All of a sudden it would come on and not put any heat out. Because the heat blows. The blower part came on but the heater wouldn't turn red or come on. I have 2 of these. It definitely lowered the cost and worked awesome until it went out. My one is still working but I've only had it 2 months. The first went out after 4 months. I sent it back to be told its the heating element and literally the price for the element is about the cost of the heater its self. I would not recommend it. Their worth it for the time they work. But to expensive for it to go out after a time frame that short."", ""I've looked, but can't find anything wrong with it.  Heats like an absolute champ!!  Very pleased with the purchase!  (Oh, I'm not a robot!)"", 'Seems to hold temp consistent hopefully will not break the bank on power, using as freeze protection in RV', ""The heater is small enough to provide heat when I needed it, but has to directly be pointed at me.The good part is that it is remote controlled so you don't have to get up all the time to adjust the temperature as needed.Also, it looks good and blends with current modern decors.The only thing was that it takes a while to heat me up when I am in a big room and it gets very warm when I am in a small room that it has to be turned off.Again, thankfully, it is remotely controlled."", ""Very happy so far with unit.  I've had it only a few weeks, but it has made my home office much more comfortable to work in.  The room is almost all windows, so on cold and damp days, I was miserable.  This little unit heats up the space so well I've had to turn it completely off occasionally.  Very happy with that!  Still learning to use the settings and remote."", ""I bought this infrared heater to replace one I was using for my Coatimundi.  He needs the temperature a constant 73 degrees and we have been having quite frigid winter weather and just can't heat the whole house to this temp.  This heater is GREAT!  Runs when it needs to and the room is toasty and warm and helps my pet to be more active than just sitting in his bed covered with his blanket.  Also I know  he won't get burned or hurt.  This heater is just wonderful and is nice and small in size but really kicks out the heat.  The value was great too.  I would recommend anyone who wanted to warm up a room or two to get this heater.  Also is very classy looking I would not mind having it in any room in my house."", ""this little heater is just wonderful. I had a Sun Heater that had quit working and I was cautious in purchasing a heater at such a low price.  I am sooo glad did. It heats my whole apartment. And having a remote is truly nice.  It has reduced my electric bill, since now I don't have to use my baseboard electric heat!!!!  love this product"", 'The advertisement says will heat 1800 sq. ft.  Not even close.  we have it in our kitchen which is 480 square feet.  We set the temperature at 80 degrees and the thermometer on an inside wall shows 66 degrees.

Mr Heater - Big Buddy Portable Propane Heater - Includes Hose and filter,115.0, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.

Portable Heater 400watt Under Desk Heater With Slim Fit Design And Silent Energy,114.23,30-day returns,"[""A real case of caveat emptor. I obviously didn't lok too hard at the dimensions, as it's absolutely tiny. I grew up with electric oil-filled radiators that ran the length of a room, so find it odd it's so hard to find anything bigger of this shape. The metal seems thin, so I'm  not surprised others have complained of leaks developing. Again, I don't remember the ones I grew up with ever having a problem. It's sitting in a corner unused as I can't think where it's going to be useful. It might air the clothes in my cupboard, but as for heating anything larger, I don't see that happening."", 'It\'s in an important place in my chicken house operating very well.   We\'ll see how it does when temperature here in the American Midwest reaches 18 degrees below zero  I hae it ina small chicken house within an old milkshed that I\'m completing Styrofoam insulation, hopefully before winter sets in.  So far, the all is well with the temp down to 37 degrees a couple nights.   It is supplemented by two steady red heat lights and another thermostatically controlled heater by another manufacturer.  Meantime, pardon the ironic ""sweating an expected hard winter"" situation!   I do highly recommend this space heater and am sure it will work out for any close space.  Beats space heaters with hot elements hands down for safety.', 'Bought this heater in October. Have used it for a month inside a small bedroom (10 x 12 feet). Not an ideal heater for high heat needs. Eg. It helped the temp in the bedroom not drop so low that we wake up cold (was 28degF low this past week), however when set at its max heat setting all night long, the max temp inside room in the morning was 58-59F. So, not adequately warm. Our bedroom door was tightly shut and has only one window that is closed.Pros:Silent. Very light weight, so portable. Cuts off if tipped over even slightly at an angle or when knocked down to floor.Saves money on electricity!!Cons:Not adequate heating. Best heat if you stand right on top of it, between your legs :-)', 'This heater is light and slim.  It can fit in narrow spots however I would not recommend putting it in position that is close to other items.It is very hot and does NOT radiate heat like other oil heaters.  It is hot because the heat is not radiated out away from the heater.It does keep the ""chill"" of the bathroom however the cost of operating it may be higher than other radiator heaters.  I say this because more heat generation requires more electricity.I bought two of these and might put them in the trash because I don\'t know anyone I\'d want to bless with these ill-performing heaters.', ""I was looking for a small space heater for a back room in my house that doesn't benefit from the furnace heat.  The size of this heater is great, and it keeps the room at a nice even temperature. It's nice and compact. The one drawback I have found is the legs that accompany it are plastic, and over time the heat softens them, causing the heater to lean backward or forwards, which in my opinion is unsafe since it could possibly fall over. The effect of the heat on the legs is quite noticeable. The manufacturer should consider making the legs out of a material that is heat resistant."", 'i purchased the newair portable space heater for additional heat in main room.  my first oil filled heater.  it seems to making sounds like a hot water radiator, and the surface of heater is too hot.  will donate it to local charity', 'I have this in my bathroom to help with the cold in the morning.

Lightweight and thin to help minimize how much space it needs once set up.', 'This is exactly what we were looking for.  We use noisy forced-air heaters in the RV to ""take the chill off"".  So far, this unit is great.  It keeps the whole RV about 10-degrees above ambient, with no noise.  It is just 400-watt, so it will never keep up with a 1500W \'blowers\'.It is quite compact.ONE ISSUE.  The surface gets quite hot (~ 150-deg?).

I wasn\'t looking for something to go under my desk, but rather, a room heater. It\'s a great heater - as long as you\'re within 6"" of it - or closer. I love the thin profile and stylish looks of it. Instead of returning it, I chose to donate it to the animal shelter to either use or put into their annual yard sale which is a huge event.

The representative was more interested in arguing semantics like wind vs. breeze rather than addressing the issue at hand. I was totally frustrated and am totally dissatisfied with this product. I would absolutely NOT recommend this product to anyone who is planning on using it outdoors for any reason.

The representative was more interested in arguing semantics like wind vs. breeze rather than addressing the issue at hand. I was totally frustrated and am totally dissatisfied with this product. I would absolutely NOT recommend this product to anyone who is planning on using it outdoors for any reason.

NEW Lasko AW300 Convection Heater Bladeless Heatr w Remote Ctrl,111.98, ,"['This heater is great with small children around. I recently purchased this second heater for a second room. My grandchildren were playing in the living room where one of the heaters was on. I popped into the kitchen for a second and when I returned my two year old granddaughter was playing ring a round the heater. She was putting her arm all the way through the ""hole"" in the middle and was not getting burned. No, I don\'t let them play with it, the point being ""if"" they do touch it they don\'t get burned. I believe these heaters are some of the safest on the market for that reason alone. They also perform very well! There is only one negative thing I have to say, when new, these heaters have a burning plastic smell that will make you think it is burning up and will cause you to want to return it. Before you do, put it in the garage, turn it up as hot and as high as it will go and let it run for a day or so. This will ""burn"" off the unpleasant burning plastic smell ""before"" you use it in your house or office.', 'Works great.', 'Works as described', 'Great product.

The front grill (chromed) will turn dark a bit but that’s to be expected. Enough heat for a 4x6m room when usign Liquid Propane gas. I used Butane and it was amazingly efficient (you feel the heat even with the pilot! Not even a single burner) but butane is difficult to find where i live.Comes with gas regulator, ready for a left internal thread. Easy to operate and very light to move around the house. Planning to buy another one for the 1st floor of the house. ', 'Amazing.  Really throws out a lot of heat.  Easy to set up, easy to use.  Cools off super fast too.  I use it on a front porch that has vinyl covers the open areas and open holes through the concrete base.  Maybe 100 square feet and on low it gets warm and toasty.

I use it in the evening just to keep my electric bill down."", ""the buddy company makes one similar but this one makes the same heat it is a construction heater so not intended for use in your home(but that is just for the lawyers it is meant to heat a small area but one without clutter since items should be away from a 3 foot radius of 180 deg of the front the pilot lighting can be confusing for the stupid since you have to constantly hold down the pilot position for a few seconds then click the ignitor and leave it held down till the thermocouple heats which takes about 15 secondsso if you are a moron just buy an electric heateri heat my front room on setting 3 till it gets as warm as i like it  than outside then switch it to position 2 only complaints are the wheels don't roll well(yes i have the locking wheels unlocked)and the tank fitting is the old left hand  type instead of the easier to use new plastic (righty tighty)acme type that is on all propane tanks made after 1996also taking off and putting on the flimsy rear tank retainer is a bit annoying it would be better if it had a hinge and latch  instead of tabs and slots"", 'Needed something for back up heat due to our electricity being off frequently during storms and etc. This is an excellent source of quick and versatile heat. The ability to adjust from 6,000 to 18,000 BTUs makes it perfect. Build quality seems to be adequate. This is really a no brainer.', ""By every measure, this is wonderful heater. This heater quickly heats a 144 sqft room in 3-4 mins when using it at full capacity going from 40F to 70F. Excellent starting with the pilot light and it is easy to move (but the castors are probably not the greatest). At minimum capacity keeps an entire 2000sqft house from going below 62F when it is 22F outside (but this will also be dependent on air allowed in and insulation as well). Unlike electric, this gives off a pleasant infrared light that will heat things it is pointed at. This is quite nice since heated air is lighter than colder air and rises, but a chair or clothing 3-10ft away will warm from the light emissions. You can sit 3 ft away from it and warm your hands as if it was a camp fire from this light. You can also feel the hot air going straight up into the air.  Make sure you keep clear of the grill as in loose clothes or your leg. Also according to directions you are not suppose to leave it on unattended. But, one of the first things we did was roast marshmallows using long metal rods. For s'mores, you can get the perfect golden marshmallow. (even though it's not marketed as a marshmallow toaster).Between medium-to-high quality, portability, cost efficiency, and the shear fact that it paid for itself in less than one month from switching away from heating with electricity, I give it five stars.  "", 'We have heat pumps in our house and on those really cold nights they just don’t do the trick. We got this heater just for a little extra warmth and we have been shocked on how easy and warm it is. I found out that we only need to run it on low because medium and height is way to much.

Mr. Heater F215100 MH4B Little Buddy 3800-BTU Indoor Safe Propane Heater Medium,110.49, ,"['Even though it cost almost 1 1/2 One Pound Coleman tanks from 9pm to 5am,  it’s great. Keeps my whole RV toasty warm. I would recommend by a large propane tank to refill the 1 pound tanks. Much cheaper. But I’ve not been cold once. The safety feature of turning off it it tilts is great. Only problem I have found is the bottom piece you place on propane tank does not secure properly and falls off when lifted off the ground to move the heater. ', 'This little buddy heater is a fine unit for use in an ice fishing shelter or flip over sled / tent. It is the right size and has a small footprint.The angle of the head heating element is perfect for warming wet hands and can be easily aimed to direct the heater output.The only down side is that it can be difficult to light in even the slightest breeze.', ""This is just the right amount of heat and size  for my needs compared to the regular Mr. Heater but does not hold up to heavy use. Have had a regular size that I use in an icefishing house that has years of use on it. The little buddies I've had are lucky to make an ice season before getting had to light and the just quitting. Love the little buddies while they work but the regular Mr buddy is a much better long term value."", 'I bought this to heat my ice fishing hut and only used it a handful of times. Looks like it’s made pretty durable, the igniter works good, like the carry handle, the metal shield cools down pretty quick if you want to move spots. The negatives are the sensor for the automatic shut off is way too sensitive, if you dont have it pretty close to PERFECTLY flat it goes out which is a pain. Also there is no heat control so once it’s first lit it’s just barely staying lit, can’t have any wind blow on it or it goes out, plus once the honeycomb section is lit well finally and red it’s burning propane at such a low rate heat does not blow out of it, it only rises from it. I guess the plus to that is low propane consumption but it would be nice to be able to crank it up if you want to blow some heat at you. This is a new school version of a metal coffee can with a roll of toilet paper inside soaked in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol. ', ""These things do a good job of heating my small fish house, but it does not take long and they get hard to light and won't work Have gone through three in three ice fishing seasons.. The regular size Mr. Heater is more reliable and I should probably just stick with those but the smaller size and a bit less btu's just works better in my tiny and very well insulated fish house.Have tried the cleaning method described in the manual but it is very hard to take apart and nothing seems to help."", 'Bought 3 fir use to heat bedrooms in the house during power outages.  Just arrived and a week later a planned one day power outage.  With new born baby, needed to ensure both mom and baby would stay warm.  Used the heater and it was fine.  ', ""I have the larger Mr. Heater for our sailboat works great! So I bought this for our RTT roof top tent ..works good don't get as hot which is good for a tent ,But! the base that holds the 1lb tank should be twice the size feels like it could fall over .I plan on fabricating a larger base :)                                                                        -=CC=-"", ""Not cheap. It is tippy with the 1 lb cylinder. I asked Mr Heater for a parts list to hard pipe it directly to a 5 lb or 20 lb cylinder and I got parts list for using a hose. I don't want to use a hose. I like that it is quiet. I like that you don't need matches. I wish it had more than 1 heat output setting. It seems to be the best match available of heat output needed for my collapsible fish house."", ""I used this in my motorhome to keep the chill off at night and not have to use the furnace, which runs the batteries down significantly while boon-docking. It will run for 6 hours on one propane bottle, so it will not last all night. However, if you start it at midnight, it will run until 6 AM, at which time you can turn on your furnace for a short time if you're an early riser. Alternatively, if you don't want to run the furnace in order to save batteries, you could light the burners on your stove. Be sure to crack a window so as not to deplete all the oxygen. This unit works well."", ""Light weight. Compact.It doesn't take up allot of space. Easy to use. Does a good job heating my Ice Fishing Hub perfectly.

12 VOLT 300 WATT Car ELECTRIC HEATER w/ FAN UTV Cab Golf Cart RV Truck Auto,114.74,Last item available,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product? It really depends upon your application need. I put this in my truck due to no floor board heat. It does help but the heat is so so at best.

LASKO 5572 PRODUCTS CERAMIC TOWER HEATER,110.79,30-day returns,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater. And If I have to replace any one of the heaters I have, it will be with a Lasko 5572 heater.HJ of Missouri', ""We were absolutely thrilled with the size and capability of this room heater.  It's a little taller than the other Lasko portable heater and our decision to get it was a good one. For our needs, this one is perfect. "", 'I really enjoy my heater.  I live in Arizona where it is getting cooler at night now.  It is very efficient and quiet.', 'Heats small area immediately in the morning, with an increase of 5-10 degrees in temperature within 15 minutes.  Easy to operate, with remote.  As usual: follow directions in the manufacturers manual for best results!', ""Wow, does this put out some heat, and like now..  Don't have to wait for anything to warm up  immediate heat..  2 modes low 900w and high 1500w..  Plus you can set it from 39 degrees to 90 degrees and to kick on automatically if room gets below set temp..  This can almost heat my whole house..  Will prob heat at least 3 rooms.Led readouts are bright and clear, fan, remote, oscillates, has real buttons, not plastic film that will wear out, and stands tall.  Has handle for easy moving.. With gas prices doubling this winter, I'm turning to a space heater so I can lower the thermostat.. "", 'great heater, used it all winter, no problems, good price, fast delivery', ""I don't have this exact model, but I have two similar Lesco 1500w heaters w/digital displays w/remotes.  I bought the second one because one of our tenants lost the remote.  One is #5165, the other one is #755320, the only complaint I have on this model is I had to stick a piece of foam tale on the top of the carrying slot in back so my finger wouldn't slip out of the carrying slot when carrying the heater.  The other heater's slot is angled so your fingers don't slip out.  The one remote does control either heater.  I recommended my satisfaction to a friend and he bought one and is happy with it.

Broan-NuTone 157 Low-Profile Fan-Forced Ceiling Heater Enclosed Sheath Elemen...,111.91,30-day returns,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation. The power to the heater tested good.', ""Love this little heater, just renivating my Mum's home.   It's so nice to have this little heater in the basement bath.  Very reasonable in price and a nice touch!!!"", 'Brand new unused, unopened.  Excellent purchase. ', 'The Broan 157 ceiling heater is a great upgrade from the "" twisted wire element "" heater. This unit has a solid element like on a stove top burner and heats my bathroom better.

"Mr. Heater F242010 MH4GC Golf Cart Heater,Silver and Black",111.27, ,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

Infrared Liquid Propane Portable Heater,113.25,30-day returns,"['Product is easy to assemble, simple to operate and has adjustable output making it great for small and larger areas. Wish it could be used indoors for emergency power outages but it does not have an oxygen depletion sensor which is necessary for that purpose. Great product to use on your deck for cool to cold temperature outings in fall and winter. ', 'This heater does work.  I have had a couple of hic-ups with it though.  One burner shut off a couple times...but did finally stay on the last time I lit it.The final reason why I decided to by the Mr. Heater is because the statement said it was made in the USA.  Not so!!!  When I received it, I looked on the box and it said (MADE IN CHINA).Disappointing.  I, personally, am REALLY tired of buying stuff made in China!!!  If there was a neutral button, I would have gone all neutral.BUY USA....  Thank you, Tom', ""Pro's~~puts out a lot of heat fast.  I haven't  used it enough to rate its fuel consumption efficiency.  Propane here is around three bucks a gallon.  Easy assembly to get it working.con's~~I don't know if this is a con, but their are wires and tubing exposed right next to the heat pans and it just seems like they could be in conduit or something.  These are visible in the pictures shown.  Maybe perfectly safe, just look iffy."", 'I have one other Mr. Heater product and it works fine so I purchased this unit. The unit goes out constantly whenever a slight breeze is blowing. It is extremely frustrating having to constantly be watching the outages. I contacted customer service at Mr. Heater to explain the issue and got only one argument after another. The representative was more interested in arguing semantics like wind vs. breeze rather than addressing the issue at hand. I was totally frustrated and am totally dissatisfied with this product. I would absolutely NOT recommend this product to anyone who is planning on using it outdoors for any reason. This is an ongoing issue as I have since read several reviews from others who have the same problem with this product. I have disconnected the unit and it is in my shed where it will probably stay until I can find someone who is willing to give me a couple of bucks for it.', 'This is a great tank top. I have had several brands so I know good from not so good. This lights easily, stays lit and provides lots of heat. Glad I bought Mr. Heater.', 'Sitting on top of a 40# tank in a corner...takes the chill off of an outside kitchen lounge area. Works perfectly..happy customer.

Could not get it to start at first set on low but starts very easily when set on medium.  Puts out good lateral heat, so it works well to gather around it,   Other heaters I considered, most of the heat goes strait up into the air.  ', ""Just got this and tried it twice this afternoon. I do not have the nerve to try it again. It assembles to the tank easily. Lights easily and burns for about three minutes on low just perfectly. Then you hear a small roaring sound that last for another 60 seconds, the BAM. Sounds like a small explosion. I think I might sit it out in the middle of my back yard and see what happens if I don't jump to shut it down immediately like I did twice today. Looks like a Chinese bomb to me.

Parts are easy to find. ', ""Love it!  We have quite a few propane tanks hanging around, so all we needed to do was get this and put it on top.  Heats up quickly.  We hang out outside and use this to keep warm.  We have the tall propane heater as well, but this one is lower and heats your midsection.  At this price, it's a great bargain!"", ""Works great.

Heller 1800W Electric Fireplace Heater Black Freestanding Flame/Fire Effect ,149.95,30-day returns,"[""Quite surprised at the finish and the construction of this heater. It really does look antique!  Two heater settings hi/low and fan assisted on both settings.  You can turn off the heat and just have the flame effect for appearance only.  The only fault I can find is that it doesn't have a thermostat to switch off the heat when the room is warm enough - it is a bit of a pain turning it on and off a couple of times during the evening. But - it does warms up the room (5m x 4m) in no time.  The flame effect and the glowing coals was a very pleasant surprise - it is quite effective and surprisingly realistic.   I am glad I purchased it .  I will give it an 8 out of 10."", 'I bought a Heller fan oh would have to be 5years maybe six years ago and still going strong with remote,now i have bought another one for the spare bedroom with remote,easy to assemble light to transfer around the house when needed such a great product.Thank you ', 'As it is not yet winter I am not sure how this will go but I’m liking the design and how it works . Hope it lives up to the reviews and design', 'Looks great, my only minus is the air flow circulating is  it strong enough. Only good for small room. Other tha that great.', 'very comforting works well with artificial flame', 'Gorgeous fire effect and works great', 'Perfect heater for the space.

Stiebel Eltron 074058 120-Volt 1500-Watts Heater Used Briefly,110.0, ,"['When I bought my business, the 4 restrooms were heated only with surface mounted electric heaters. It seemed like I was replacing one at least every 2 years. They were poorly made, noisy, and had to be run with a separate thermostat that also was prone to fail.Then I bought the Stiebel Eltron. It is quiet, attractive looking, works GREAT, and has the thermostat built in. The quality is outstanding. I plan on replacing all of them with these. (And for comparison the cost is only slightly higher.)', 'Very simple to install and provides fairly even heat in a small room or additional heat in areas that need it when extremely cold outside . This is the second unit I bought and would not hesitate to purchase again .', 'Worked well, from the reviews I was expecting better than ones at 1/2 the price.

"Surface-Mount Fan-Forced Ceiling Heater 1,250-Watt Heat Mudroom Bathroom Durable",113.0,8 watchers,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation. The power to the heater tested good.', ""Love this little heater, just renivating my Mum's home.   It's so nice to have this little heater in the basement bath.  Very reasonable in price and a nice touch!!!"", 'Brand new unused, unopened.  Excellent purchase. ', 'The Broan 157 ceiling heater is a great upgrade from the "" twisted wire element "" heater. This unit has a solid element like on a stove top burner and heats my bathroom better.

Comfort Zone CZ230ER Fan Heater,115.0, ,"[""This replaced a 40 y/o unit that worked, but not well. Having the remote control makes temperature control much easier. The high mode provides instant heat when used and the guide vanes direct the flow well. I did replace the circuit breaker as this unit has a max draw of 31.4 amps (7500 watts)on high mode, and insured the wiring and connections were proper. It's below freezing outside and this unit cycles and maintains 63-68 degrees with a 72 degree setting. The area is an insulated 900 sqft and the temperature is read on the wall furthest from the unit. Until I get a better primary heat source this is a great unit to have till then."", ""The heater is built pretty tough, which is a good thing. I also found it easy to connect, which interestingly enough was more expensive for the materials than it was for the heater. Only problem is that it doesn't heat as well as advertised. It claimed to heat an area (uninsulated) that was 30x30. my garage is 25x35 so I figured that was basically the same thing. after running for an hour or more it only brought the temp up from 45* to about 52*. I guess that if I left it running all the time it would eventually gey there, but that was not what I was hoping for. Plus, those temps were only for the emediate area around the heater, the far end of the garage was still ice cold. In any account it is a good heater for the price. especially if you already have a place wired for it."", ""Havent used it yet, but looks nice. It's smaller than I thought but as long as it heats good then I'm ok with it. I was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the plug. Luckily I have an extra one. I will have it hooked up in a couple of days. Thanks. "", ""Installed in my 2 car garage, used the correct 8ga wire and double pole breaker. On high setting, it trips the breaker. Tried a different breaker, no luck. It doesn't heat the garage as well as I anticipated, but better than having no heater at all. I like the remote, it works well. Heater is quiet. Not impressed but whatever. I may end up moving it to my basement, where I believe it may work better. "", 'After researching different heater I found this to be the best deal, but the heat sensor is on the inside witch makes it shut off sooner than it should so I located it on the outside and it now works good. I also looked on youtube to see how to hook up 220w and found it to be really easy but make sure you use 8/3 wire and a 40amp double pull breaker for safety reasons. I have a 24x30 insulated garage with 8 foot ceilings and at 32 degrees it will heat up at about 10 degrees an hour and after a while when the heat is up a little bit it seems to heat up faster so I use my kerosene heater to speed things up a little and when it gets around 68 degrees this heater can maintain very easy. now just so you know I have 4 metal cars in my garage that retain cold air for quite a while so your garage might heat up faster depending what you have in it', ""I purchased this unit to replace my old one. The unit arrived very quickly. I think it took 4 days to get to me. Packaging was very stout, no damage to the unit. I did have a friend of mine help me install it but it wasn't really hard and could have done it in a pinch. Instructions were easy to read. I have a 25x25 sq ft shop, insulated to about R4 and this heater does a nice job of warming it with outside temps around around 32F. This unit is also nice in that I have a choice of hi or lo elements used to heat.I would recommend this and install it myself if I go to a larger building."", 'Great price, great size, easy to use', ""Not happy with this heater. First of all, the thermostat is not correct, as it is located INSIDE the heater where it stays hot. Must be set much much higher for desired temp. Second, and worst of all, when the heater switches ON or OFF, it makes a extremely loud BANG. Really disappointing for the price and would return it if it wasn't hard wired in. Regret buying the warranty, as I don't plan on keeping past it's first breakdown."", 'The temperature sensor is mounted in a way that the heater cuts off way before room temperature is reached.  Believe the sensor is getting reading from the case rather than ambient temperature.  ', 'Well Made. Easy to use. Shipping was fast, with damage. Easy to install. Easy to hang. Would highly recommend it if the square footage is right and it is insulated.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Dr. Infrared Heater DR-988 Heater Standard red,114.46,30-day returns,"['This does all I need for taking the chill off our two bay shop at ""Coop\'s Miata"" in Maple Valley Washington.It is quiet and efficient. The only negative thing is the short chord and the odd plug. I had to make a 20 ft extension chord with adaptation for my shop 240 service. Ended up changing the plug on the heater chord as well.  Couldn\'t find a chord female plug for this style. Worked out that I ended up using the same mail plug I use for my Tig. Word of caution: use the right gauge wire and keep it less than 25 feet.', ""I purchased this heater in 01/2013 to replace a propane bottle heater.  It is much safer than propane and the fan circulates the heat.  I have been extremely happy with this heater as it has worked great to heat my insulated garage/shop during the cold N. IL winters.  I gave it four stars due to the fact that the fan motor uses sleeve bearings and not ball so any dirt that accumulates on the blades causes vibration and wear on the bearings.  It is important to keep the fan blades clean to reduce wear and extend the life.  I suggest cleaning every season.  I just completed cleaning blades and fan bearings and the heater works like new again.  Very easy to do with just a few screws to remove cover and fan  Don't get me wrong this is a great heater for the price.  I will look into the model 966 which has a heavier duty fan when this wears out. "", ""Don't get me wrong they put out heat... But not like people brag about on them... If your in a two bay garage it will take the chill out in roughly in a hour with the door closed. Lots of 220 power used in an hr. If you put it beside you when working on a car in the open it cycles off and on the heating element a lot as if room temperature has been reached. Cold hot cold hot.... Wasn't worth adding a 220 outlet. Says industrial use only on the warning label on top, exactly what industry would have been nice to know... Because  commercial mechanic work does not qualify...."", ""I spent almost a couple hours reading and researching several heaters to help for winter work in the garage. My final decision in this unit was the power of the fan. It was much stronger BLOWER MOTOR than many others. It is built tough/rugged like (old school box style construction). I figured with the amount of electricity this draws and the fan strength, I'd get e bit more bang for the buck. I was wrong... I've seen more impressive 110 models in the past over this. Unfortunate results for the amount of electricity you pour out. It also has a horrible cool draft off one corner. How does a heater blow a cool breeze with the hot? (Maybe the blower is to strong for the heating element?) Even standing in front of this unit, It was not impressive on the heat being generated. If you don't care about electricity and need to blow a little bit of heat a distance then I would suggest this unit for you.... everyone else, I suggest researching other units."", 'When I received this heater the box was in perfect shape, no signs of damage, but when I opened it and pulled the heater out the fan was laying in the bottom not attached to the bracket inside. Pulled the cover off and screws totally missing, fan and inside of heater looked as if it had been running with the fan hitting inside of housing. Screws not inside the heater nor in the box. Got the fan straightened out and bought screws from hardware store, remounted fan and turned the heater on. It started working and seemed to be okay. The heater coil is not suppose to turn red while it is running however on day 2 the coil is starting to turn red while heating so the coil is not going to last very long before it shorts out. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time to work on it to get it running. If I had just wanted a fan I could have bought several fans from Walmart for what this cost.', ""Using on construction site.  Keeps 3 bedroom townhouses at 70 degrees.Bought 15 open box and 1 new.  Could not tell the difference.  One heater had a loose fan bracket.Tightened screws and it was good.  Another heater had a fan that rattled. Had some play on the drive shaft.  Added a washer and it was good as new.  Can't complain because they were 1/2 the price of new ones.  Wish they had a different plug.  A dryer or range end would be better."", 'This is to backup the same model in use for a couple years, they work very well. Only complaint is new one has a high pitched fan motor whine when the unit is not under a heat load with just the fan running.  ', 'An excellent buy. Good strong heat for  an old 20 x 20 wood garage with a high peak ceiling, and no insulation in very cold weather. Had to change the 30 amp 220v electrical receptacle, but that was it.

⚡️Lifesmart 1500W 6-Element Infrared Heater with Oak Cabinet & Remote,114.99, ,"['Pros- Shorter cabinet makes smaller footprint, Nice large easy read temp setting, Looks good, Does a good job heating a coolish 300 sq ft. room.Cons- Shorter cabinet requires faster fan setting I guess. My other larger cabinet one blows slower and much quieter. I really wish it had fan speeds. Lot louder.Tip for the day,Some people complain these heaters wont heat the room. Make sure and close the doors of the room. But the other room is venting warmer air into the cooler room you say. Does not matter close the doors and it will work.', ""Great little heater, I live in an apartment I use it in my living room when I get chilled it helps bring my room temperature up so I'm not setting here freezing it really does help for a small space heater it works just like the larger ones it has temperature control it comes with a remote control you can turn it on and off set the temperature I'm using it right now"", 'item works great for room heating. they are a very safe heater.  I have 4 of these units in my home plus a wood burning fireplace.  I also have a large heat pump.  no worries about the cold.', 'I bought a life smart heater about 5 years ago and it has been greatly used due to the long winters we have in this part of New York. When it broke this year, I bought the same brand as I felt it was a good value for what we had paid.  It heats quickly and has a strong blower to push the heat in to the room. We run this on a dedicated circuit and find it is very economical.', ""Heats well and fan is quiet, turns off when not needed. Warms entire room but portable enough to direct the heat towards a area where i'm sitting."", 'I have one in my living room and one in my basement. My electric bill only went up about 15$ a month. They are a good full time heater or a good spot heater.', ""This is the second one of these we've purchased in the last year. Love the digital temp. selector and the remote makes this a very convenient area heater. The oak cabinet makes it blend right in like a piece of furniture. Priced right and a great heater."", ""For the price it is a good choice. Doesn't heat as well as the Edenpure it replaced. It is quite and for the money seems well built. Only time will tell if was a good purchase."", 'Heater is good for medium size room. I actually heat about 350 sf of room with it. The thermostat can be set at a comfortable temp and easily changed is easy to use remote.', ""I was very leary on buying something that says SAVE MONEY BY LOWERING YOUR HEATING BILL. This thing does not do what the advertisement said it would. We have a very small house total sq ft less than 1000 and it wouldn't even heat a room less than 200 sq ft.

1500W Electric Space Heater Garage Forced Air Fan Portable Utility Home Shop New,110.29,30-day returns,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time. I put the heater in max mode and not matter what it just wasn't throwing out enough heat.You literally have to be right in front of the heater to feel anything. I wanted something affordable that was not powered by propane however they do say u get what you paid for."", ""I bought two of these for my garage and disregarded the previous reviews i read. The fan barely puts air out. It gets hot, but the fan almost seems like the motor is junk. I'll still use it. I'll just put a box fan behind it so it can actually move heat around."", ""The heater is built well and is safe however its useless in a garage or outdoors. I would recommend it for use in a indoor room or basement environment where it doesn't have to compete with more harsh temperatures. Not exactly what I was hoping for!"", 'This looks good in the pictures, but is a terrible heater. The forced air is a joke. Plus it does not get hot. With the thermostat on high, after 15 minutes, I could still hold my hand about six inches in front of the grill. Very disappointed.', 'I thought I was going to buy this to upgrade the heater I use at work in the shop. I ended up just putting it in my car that I’m working on on the side of my house. It gets to about 80° inside just a car. I don’t expect it would be able to heat the shop. The fan is very weak as well.', 'It is good product for the price, it is slow on heating a large area but keeps it at a good temperature.', 'It came in a timely manner and works great as long as its pointed at you.

Mr Heater Buddy Portable Indoor Radiant Safe Heater MH9BX 9000 BTU 225 SQ ,114.95, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.

I currently have one very similar which is 10 years old &amp; still going after heavy use.  It did make a strange noise recently &amp; decided to buy another one just in case it might be wearing out.  However, haven't heard the noise again.  This is an updated model of my old one."", ""Overall this is a good little heater. It has a small footprint and it will warm a small-medium size room in about 15-20 minutes.  The ability of the unit to oscillate and the fact that it has remote control makes this about as convenient as it gets. Lots of good features and controls. Only caution is to make sure that you don't have two of these units plug into outlets that are on the same breaker.  If you do the breaker has to be at least 20amps. Anything less will trip the breaker on high draw when the heaters are warming the room. This is definitely more efficient than powering up to central heater for the whole house."", 'My last lasko heater lasted 7 years and was used a lot. I love the design of the new one. Hopefully it lasts as long as my first one. This one is quieter with a remote👍', 'This works well in heating our family room.  Saves heating the whole house.

Mr. Heater F232050 4K - 9K BTU Portable Buddy Heater,113.15,60-day returns,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Broan-NuTone 157 Low-Profile Fan-Forced Ceiling Heater, Enclosed Sheath Eleme...",114.1,60-day returns,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.
