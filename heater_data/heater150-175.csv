"HeatMate 10,600 BTU Radiant Kerosene Heater HMN110",153.11,30-day returns,"[""I currently have a couple of these kerosene heaters and I like to rotate them out every so often, as to not let the wick from just one get all of the use over the winter season. I have never had any problem with this heater and I would never go thru a winter without a couple of them. I always try to have a back up to what I use the most of, so I won't be without one working, just in case. They put out excellent heat in my room size of 15' X 24'. Also great if the power ever was to go out for a while during cold times. When the heater is fired up and the mantle is all glowing without any flame going higher than the mantle, I notice very little kerosene smell. Mine have been a life saver over the years that I've owned them. Bruce; TN."", ""I was not happy when I first got this heater.  The flame adjustment was only usable when it is in the all the way up position.  It should start out high and then after it mellows out you adjust it down.  Also the fumes were terrible!  I could not use it indoors.  I had tried it 3 times and would have sent it back but as it was heavy and a large box I just didn't want the hassle.  I pulled it off the back porch last night for one last try.  It worked great!  I stood right over it and inhaled and no fumes at all!  I was using K1 kero at 4.99 a gallon for indoor use.  So...it could be when a heater is new it has to burn a few tanks to get to where it needs to be.  I am satisfied now but still wish the wick came up higher...but it is a good heater...you just have to burn it off a few times."", 'Work great no fumes and heats up a room with a tin roof and cement floor real good', 'Heater is amazing.

It was a 1500 watt model, but after installing the Com-Pak, that was only 1000 watts, it's output was higher. And it's construction was obviously of high higher quality.  And it is much quieter than old was, even when it was new. Only problem I had was it was slightly smaller to fit into the original hole in the wall.  Not the fault of the heater.

10 American Wick Kerosene Heater Wicks  #AW-500 NEW  Fits many perfection models,152.99,8 watchers,"['I got these wicks for my antique Perfection kerosene heaters (I bought several more to keep on hand after trying two). In my opinion, this wick actually out-performs the (new old stock) Perfection Brand wicks available for sale, which can be smelly from age, sometimes bent or rusted, and the cotton wick material, itself, tends to be a bit stiff from age, and occasionally are reconditioned or simply moved in the carrier to appear to be new when they are, in fact, used. I\'ve had that result twice from buying ""new"" old stock Perfection Brand wicks. This American Wick AW-500 fits perfectly, works smoothly, and is made with superior materials and craftsmanship. The wick is all cotton, heavy-duty and is long-lasting. It\'s clean-burning and there is no smoke or odor. The steel wick carrier is sturdy and smooth. Unlike the Perfection Brand wick, the American AW-500 is constructed with 4 splits in the lower part which go into the tank, creating 4 ""tails"" (NOTE: The lower portion of the wick is not visible in photo, as they are tucked inside its own cylindrical carrier in packaging, and in the photo). The American Wick AW-500 wick is very similar to the Perfection Brand 500 wick, but the Perfection  wick is split in 2 places and has 2 tails. In my opinion, the American AW-500 wick with 4 tails works better and is easier to install, because the 4-way tail split allows the wick tales to be more easily maneuvered around the wick adjuster, to seat a bit lower when turned down, and the tails to dip deeper into the kerosene tank and are more neatly adjusted up and down without binding at all. The cost of this item is very reasonable and I think it\'s a great value, compared with the usually higher-priced original Perfection 500 wicks to be found for sale. I hesitated at first to buy this non-Perfection part for my Perfection heaters, but after a couple of bad experiences with the more costly Perfection wicks, I am so glad I took the chance and bought the American AW-500 wicks! I\'m extremely pleased! I highly recommend this excellent product! ', ""These are not very heavy weight, the weave is loose, and they are not even close to the high quality brand name wick I order from England.  Cosmetically it's not nice looking as an original Perfection wick . Heavy metal wick sleeve is good and they are nicely fastened with metal riveting. They will work just fine in a Perfection 500 heater they just don't last as long as the other brand I buy and they will burn down a little bit faster.  If I can get a good deal on an AW-500 wick or this is the only one available it is much better than a fiberglass wick. Just make sure that you are gentle installing the wick and if one gets a lot of tar from contaminated fuel, moisture,  improper use,  and sticky in the wick gallery these will tear. Odor wise they will smell terrible when you burn one in for the first time that is normal because they are not pre charred. If you run at the highest flame setting possible in the Perfection 500  heater burning good quality kerosene they will do a good job. I use a Perfection 500 heater burning clear kerosene every day year round as my only source of heat and for cooking? If I can get a good deal on one or more of these AW500 wicks I will buy them.   "", 'Excellent quality.  AW-45 is lower part of a mechanical wick; AW-40 is the top part only; AW-49 is both top and bottom.  AW-45, as the bottom only, appears to be no longer available from wick manufacturers.  Grab them if you can find them!', 'Fits just as it should. Burns great in my Perfection M525 Heater. Will definitely buy again, although this one will last me for a few years.', 'Much better quality wick than even more expense wicks out there.  This one burns like the OEM all cotton wick with normal  charring as it should.  Other wicks I have used seem to have a high percentage of nylon or other synthetic and leave a hard residue after just one or two burns that is then hard to relight.  This wick has none of that and I will buy buy another just to have one hand. ', ""I was skeptical to purchase at first, considering they don't manufacture the Perfection Heaters anymore, but I took a chance and was very happy this wick is quite similar to an original Perfection wick, and it's 100% cotton. The only issue I experienced was that the gear holes on the wick canister didn't exactly line up correctly. Fortunately I was able to transfer the wick to the original wick canister which has gear holes all around it, making it much easier to install."", 'I had to get another one because it had burned down. When I forget to turn off the heater, the wick will burn down one quarter of an inch each time. I probably will be ordering another soon. Thanks for the product and price.', 'Heater is 100yrs. old, was easy to install,glad wick was still available.', 'These were great! I have two 50 year old vintage kerosene heater and these worked out perfectly!! I highly recommend these!', ""The next best thing to the 'Perfection' brand wick. Second one I bought.

"Electric Baseboard Heater Cadet 96 In. 2,000/2,500 Watt 240 Volt White Durable",151.2,30-day returns,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"DeLonghi Mica Thermic Panel Heater, 2 Heat Settings, Black HMP1500 1500 Watts",151.99,30-day returns,"[""I like this heater a lot. I bought two of them. One I've mounted on my bedroom wall. The other I left on its wheels so I can move it around the house. And it does have a very comfortable recessed carrying handle. It does give off an offensive odor at the beginning, so I recommend placing it outside, running, for 3-4 hours and that should burn off the smell. It's very, very quiet but not totally silent. I has a slight audible hum, which I thought would bother me at first, but I've easily adjusted to it. In fact, I learned to find it comforting, like white noise. I find listening to its slight hum and feeling its warming comfort actually induces me to go to sleep. It's a radiant heater, but unlike the older type radiant heaters, it doesn't cook you. It has two settings. On Minimum (800 watts), only the top one third of the heater heats up. On Max (1500 watts), the entire heater heats up. It can heat up my 10' by 10' bedroom on a very cold day (around 32 degrees) within in an hour.  The only fault that I've found with this heater is that the automatic shut off alarm can kick in too soon, before the it's completed its job, but that happens only on Max. Otherwise, once I warm up my bedroom, I can run it on Minimum all night with no disturbing alarm. I've put it on a remote controlled timer switch that can be set to shut off at intervals of 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, or longer. I do this to save electricity. Just be sure the timer you buy can handle more than 1500 watts. At the same time, it's also plugged into a remote controlled thermostat (available on eBay). I set the heater's thermostat to its highest setting, and let the remote thermostat control when the heater comes on and off."", 'warms quickly, feels healthy, large surface heat area. best heater so far. thanks', ""I came to the conclusion that this heater would be a good pick for a bedroom. I ended up purchasing this DeLonghi Mica Panel Heater for the bedroom. The reason I chose this brand over other mica panels is due to my experience with their products in the past. I've owned a DeLonghi Radiator Heater which has worked just as great. If you dont know much about DeLonghi, they are a European-based company that makes quality appliances, specifically utilizing German-engineering."", 'I bought this heater to replace my oil filled radiator which stopped working. It is for a 12 foot by 12 foot bedroom. The old radiator heated the room comfortably but took a while to get up to heat.

Dr Infrared Portable Space Heater W/ Dual Heating System 1500 Watt Tans,152.11,30-day returns,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit. Doesn't even look like a heater, more like a piece of furniture or a speaker for a high end stereo system."", 'I hen purchase several brands of infrared heaters .   Dr. Heater is built solid .  Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.  Am not able to determine if I am saving money on this product or not running it continuously versus other types of heating methods.  Product works well - happy so far.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

New LASKO 758000 Cyclonic Ceramic Heater,150.34, ,"['The Lasko Cyclonic ceramic Heater is a great choice to heat a room.  Why?  well, here is what I think about my new heater.First, i was looking for a heater to use in my 160 Sq ft shop, that didn\'t take up a whole bunch of space. The Lasko heater is a good compact size, unlike Baseboard heaters that take up three to five or more feet of wall space, where you can\'t put things in front of them, this heater is only about 17"" wide.  Or my former oil radiator heater, that works well, but I had to pull it out from the wall to use it, as it gets hot all around it.This heater will heat a larger room, but I chose it because I wanted a fairly fast warm up, when I start to work.  I chose Electric because I don\'t want fumes or have to worry about getting Propane, or Kerosene.  I like the feel of the Electric heat.This heater has a thermostat that can be set, and a timer if you want it to go off by itself. Very Convenient !  It draws the cool air from the floor, and blows warm air out the top, from it\'s moveable ( up and down) exhaust.  The Fan forced air can travel most of the way across the room, which helps circulate the warmth evenly.The heater fan has two speeds so it\'s quiet enough to use in a bedroom if you want, and can be put right up against the wall so it\'s out of the way.I have used this in my shop for several days now, some as cold as 25 degrees outside, and this Lasko heater warms the shop up to a comfortable (for me) 68 deg. in about 30 minutes.Because it\'s only 25"" tall, the temperature the display on the front says, may need to be adjusted to your own likings, but I\'ve found once the whole room has warmed up the temp. displayed is within 2 degrees of the Thermometer I have on the other end of the room.So it does keep up with the set temperature when in thermostat mode fairly well. You can just have it on low heat or high heat all the time, but I like the convenience of the thermostat mode. It\'s simple to operate, and comes in several colors, to match your decor. While the housing is mostly Plastic, the Heater is sturdy enough. Because it is only 6.5"" deep, it stays tucked up tight ot the wall out of my way, and doesn\'t heat up the wall, like my oil/electric radiator did, but fear not if you tip it over, it has automatic shutoff.I don\'t have any complaints about this heater. I think it\'s just about perfect for small shops like mine, or a cold bedroom , or even to heat larger areas. Lasko made a good all around Electric heater here.', ""i've been using these for 7yrs now, after 4yrs took apart and cleaned them (i have 5) and even the 7yr old works as it did when new, i dont like to waste money so i have stuck with this model, i have the electronic version also (black)at another location, they are okay but not built the same inside, these seem to be better built, they do what they are designed to do, and i always use the ceiling fan to bring the heat down and mix it up so they dont run forever. i run 1 in each bedroom and two in the living room, not too loud, i know they are not a furnace, temperature at the grill is abt 200 degrees coming out so i use the ceiling fans on low or medium to help mix it up otherwise all the heat stays up at the ceiling. I feel this is the best heater in this class."", 'Nice heater that does a great job. Already own 6. Is an inexpensive way to heat house and safer as well. Does not impact the electric bill hardly any at all. Do not have to worry about tipping over, has solid stand. I use to use gas as a means of heating my two story house until I found this type of heater. I have purchased four or five other heaters of this type for relatives and friends.', ""bought two of them in the past 2 years and both of them were defective. I have one that is 10 to 15 years old and still works. that's why i wanted one the same brand. MUST NOT BE TESTING THEM !!!"", 'Unstable. No tip over feature. Never stopped outgassing plastic smell.', 'Borrowed a lasko heater last year coverage was great economical and safe so bought the same model very happy with it!', 'This heater works safely when it is sitting against the wall. To adjust to any temperature is very easy. It also shows the actual temperature in the area.', 'I purchased this heater, to use in my RV.  It is quite efficient.  Enjoying the efficiency and temperature control.  ', ""I now own three (3) of 'em... The oldest one is starting its 5th winter.  "", ""OUR LIVING ROOM IS BIG AND WE KEEP THE THERMOSTAT DOWN TO 68 WE NEEDED AN EXTRA HEATER TO HELP KEEP IT WARMER. WE DO NOT LIKE IT HOT TO SLEEP SO WE TRIED THIS. REALLY LIKE IT CAN STAND IT AGAINST THE WALL AND NO WORRIES. THE AIR IS DRAWN IN THE BOTTOM AND COMES OUT THE TOP NICE AND WARM.THE ONLY CHANGE I WOULD MAKE IS FOR THE AIR TO BE DRAWN IN THE TOP AND COME OUT THE BOTTOM NICE AND WARM,DUE TO COLD FLOORS. TRIED TO FIND ONE BUT DIDN'T. ANYHOW, THIS HEATER IS VERY GOOD.EASY TO MOVE.

Presto HeatDish Parabolic Electric Heater plus Footlight,150.0, ,"['Our furnace broke and we used this heater for 5 days.  It is awesome.

It worked great until one day I heard a pop and it died. I searched online for tips to fix, but it seems when it dies, it dies. It did work well though.

New LASKO AW300 Bladeless Heatr w Remote Ctrl,154.7, ,"['This heater is great with small children around. I recently purchased this second heater for a second room. My grandchildren were playing in the living room where one of the heaters was on. I popped into the kitchen for a second and when I returned my two year old granddaughter was playing ring a round the heater. She was putting her arm all the way through the ""hole"" in the middle and was not getting burned. No, I don\'t let them play with it, the point being ""if"" they do touch it they don\'t get burned. I believe these heaters are some of the safest on the market for that reason alone. They also perform very well! There is only one negative thing I have to say, when new, these heaters have a burning plastic smell that will make you think it is burning up and will cause you to want to return it. Before you do, put it in the garage, turn it up as hot and as high as it will go and let it run for a day or so. This will ""burn"" off the unpleasant burning plastic smell ""before"" you use it in your house or office.', 'Works great.', 'Works as described', 'Great product.

Mr Heater Buddy Portable Propane Indoor Outdoor Gas,200.0, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.

Mr Heater 30000 BTU Vent Free Blue Flame Propane Gas Wall or Floor Indoor Heater,150.0,Last item available,"['Great heater, literally heats my whole home, the fan could be a little more powerful but does move a little air, this was a replacement for my pellet stove, during a power outage the pellet stove would not work, with this propane Mr. heater you still have heat during an outage just no blower operation ', ""The pros are the price is reasonable and no special installations is requires. I can use my RV propane tanks, so the only extras I had to buy was a regulator and connector hose.  It puts out pretty good heat, and my CO detector doesn't go off. I use it in my 24 x 30 shop.The cons are it has an odor that gets pretty strong after an hour or more.  Additionally, if I don't open a window or crack a door, within 2 hours it depletes the oxygen in the room to the point it shuts down.  The oxygen gets so low my propane torch won't fire up.  The ventilation it requires to stay running lets a lot of cold air in, offsetting the heat it produces."", ""This is just what we needed.  We are in a remote area of Maine where we tend to get power failures in winter.  This unit works great and doesn't depend on electricity to keep us warm.  This is important since we can reach temps of -30 degrees F.  Highly recommend this unit."", 'We heat both houses with only ventless blue flame products, 10k, 20k and 30k units. This 30k propane unit is the best we\'ve come across. Very clean burning and as attractive a casing as they come, and a thermostat that works . Our 30k mock ""cast iron stove\' unit is very attractive but not as efficient. This is our second Mr. Heater and would definitely buy from BigDealOnTheHill again if they had one.', ""I bought this for a small drafty cabin I rent. hook up was easy once I ran the steel pipe from the back porch under the cabin to where I put the heater. Installed a Mr. Heater regulator on the tank end of the pipe, a Mr. Heater shut off valve and flex pipe at the heater end.I also bought and installed the optional fan for it however the it dosent turn on when you set it to auto. But constant on is ok. The temp settings seem to work fine on the heater itself though, when I put the control knob on 1, 2, 3, or 4 it shuts down and fires back up when the temp gets to those levels, I don't know what those temps actually are but on setting 5 it runs contignously."", 'This is one of the best purchases I\'ve made.  Heats very evenly with no hotspots. Wouldn\'t waste the money on the fan option. A $20 oscillating 6"" fan up high works perfectly', ""This is the best thing I have purchased.  It is Awesome,  the pilot light is so easy to start. The most wonderful about it is the built-in thermostat.  I turns the flame on and off. This keeps the house warm without me having to turn the heat on and off. Now with Mr. Heater my furnace hardly kicks on.  I'm Happy "", ""Yes hello I've tested this product as a backup heater for my home I live in California where they threaten to shut off our power supply and I believe it will be adequate for heating my home I like it. At a constant burn it's about 1 gallon / 3 hours."", 'I\'ve had one of these heater at a remote cabin where the nighttime temperatures sometime are 23F many times during the winter.  This model does a superb job of heating the entire cabin without having to turn it up above ""medium"".It is easy to use and I\'ve had for ten years without any need for maintenance. I bought an extra heater for another location.  I highly recommend this unit.', ""This was the cheapest solution(sale $155.00) instead of me adding a fire place.

Dyna-Glo Portable Forced Air Heater 60k - 125k BTU,150.0, ,"[""I won a auction for two Dyna Glo 30k-60k heaters for 75.00 shipped . Obviously by reading the description they were returned to the store for some issue and they were. The thermocouple didnt work in either one which always goes out and i always bypass anyway. They only came with one hose and regulator so i ordered another one for 8 bucks shipped. After watching a 2 minute video ( because these were different then the one i already own) it took me about 10 minutes to bypass the thermocouple on each unit and attach both hoses. I hooked both of them to a propane tank and they both worked perfectly. So i got two like new heaters for $85.00 . I read a few post before i purchased that complained about the heaters not staying lit they should have assumed they had a issue by the listing and the fact they are returns from the store. By watching a 2 minute video they couls have fixed the heater and got a great deal. A brand new thermocouple doesn't cost but 10 bucks shipped if you wanted to fix it , i prefer to bypass it . I don't like having to hold the button in for 5 minutes untill it gets hot enough to run on its on. By bypassing the thermocouple it stays lit as soon as you light it . I'm not sure how you buy a product described as returned to store and leave a bad review because it doesn't work correctly . I would have bypassed the thermocouple even if mine did work correctly but i never would have assumed it worked fine. If you looking for a brand new product work a warranty go to Lowe's arw home depot. If you have a philip head screw driver handy and you are looking for a deal like i was these work great ."", 'Pretty Quiet per se. arrived Fast. Compact with good output. Your not heating a large space Quickly with this but.. it is great for maintaining the warmth after the larger space is up to temp. Using it in a 1000 Sq. Ft 14’ side wall shop as 3rd Heater the 2 larger Kerosene jets get it toasty I shut them off and just run this propane Heater! Works Great even in Single digits outside in an Insulated Shop.Would buy again if needed.', 'Bought this heater to help supplement heat in our large informal office. We are presently using an 80,000 BTU kerosene heater but the fumes were bothering us when it shuts off other than that it warmed the large office space very quickly and evenly.We wanted to use the Dyna Glo because it is propane hoping there will be far less fumes. While we were attempting to get the heater to stay lit it was producing heat but not nearly as much as the kero 80K would. Nor did the fan push the heat throughout the office space as fast. This is only 20K BTU less but it felt far less than that.We had to return the Dyna-Glo. Maybe we will get another one or something a bit better and pay a few dollars more.', ""It was not able to heat a one car garage on the highest setting, after about 3 hours of operating, temp. was the same inside/outside of building, could only feel the heat if standing directly 2 feet in front of it, also very loud, wouldn't recommend"", 'Very good quality of product especially for the low price.', 'A very good heater  light weight  and would buy again', 'good product for the money', 'Compact /puts out lots of heat /easy set up', 'It dos the job very well !

Too new to give it 5 🌟’s but if it lasts 10 years it will be worth every penny!I purchased a 1000W Heat Storm infrared heater, a couple years ago, for 12x12 enclosure and it heats the area easily during January &amp; February making the space useable year round.I really like the auto mode vs manual select high or low setting. Has the option to wall mount but since it is “portable” and I am only using it seasonally I won’t be using that feature. My sister in-law was so impressed she purchased 1 too.', 'Love the feature of hanging on wall and is very thin but powerful.', 'The product was very easy to install.  I chose to install on the wall and found success with no problems.  It preforms as stated in the advertising.  The only con I have to this point is the decibel level.  Just a tiny bit noisy.', 'I had high hopes for this heater, but after using it a couple weeks I’m really afraid it’s going to destroy my electricity as it runs full bore and I keep my house at 66. It only has a small area to heat as well.

My wife dragged me to Lowe's to by a heater. I told her that we should buy a ceramic heater instead of a infrared heater. But like always she didn't want to listen. We ended up buying a heater for 150. This heater looks like old cast iron heater and it takes like an hour to make a room comfy. BBUUUUTTTT this Lasko heater is the BOMB and very worth it."", ""Works like a champ.  This heats my 250 square foot garage that is like an ice cube, otherwise.  I really like the thermostat feature.  I've had two of these in the past, and they have always worked well."", ""We have a small house in s.e. mich.. about 700 sq. ft. on the main level.  several years ago our furnace quit and we've been using ceramic heaters ever since.  I bought this lasco heater this fall to see if it could do better than the previous heater and it has been keeping the wholehouseat about 66 to 68 degrees so far.  Right now we are having the coldest below zero weather in years and it is still keeping things at around 60 with no other heater. needless to say, we have turned on an additional ceramic heater and the temp in the living room isaround 65. I repeat we have no other furnace or heater in the housethe basement stays around 60 all the time but as soon as the outdoors temps rise into the 20's and 30's it will be about 68 in here and we will only need the large Lasco heater.I am very happy with this heater."", 'Works well and looks like the picture, but not quite the remote I was looking for.  I understand the remote that actually went with my upright fan, the model is now out of date or for sale.', 'I plugged the space heaters in immediately and it took the chill right off the house love them. I have a heat pump and when the temperature gets below 32 the system needs help. These are perfect.', 'Quiet; Very powerful; Many fan &amp; heat speed/temperature options. Delivered much faster than even my dog\'s favorite (E-bay) dog food! The back of this unit is not even the slightest bit warm, even when temperature and fan speed are at ""max""! Greatly helps supplement our home\'s central heat, even during extremely cold weather.', ""This heater warms my apartment way better than the heating sytem for the apartment. It's easy to move around and it does not get hot so you can move it without the danger of getting burned bu holding the sides. Good choice for anyone who has to use gas heat or heat a lot. Could save you a lot of money."", 'Actually, my 5/6 year old unit is STILL GOOD. but the remote died from battery corrosion.So, I now have TWO GOOD EXCELLENT HEATERS- with One REMOTE. * works on both👍🏻', ""This heater provides a great deal of heat for a large room/ recommend it for purchase, if a person is interested a quality heater.....it's well worth the investment/ Thank you.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr. Heater Big Buddy Portable 18000 BTU Heater - Red,, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Dr. Heater DR966 240-volt Hardwired Shop or Home Garage Commercial Heater,152.0, ,"['The heater requires a 35A circuit with #8AWG wire per Article 424 of the National Electric Code. The heater only pulls 25A on highest setting, but is considered a ""fixed"" device with a ""continuous load"", so the wiring and breaker need to be rated at 125%.  That puts it at 31.25A, over a #10AWG wire and 30A breaker\'s rating.  Don\'t risk your insurance company denying your claim if something goes wrong.At that power, you don\'t want to use a line voltage thermostat designed for smaller baseboard heaters.  If you want a wall mounted thermostat, look into any conventional thermostat, a 24VAC HVAC transformer, and a 40A 2-pole 24V HVAC contactor.  I have three DR-966 heaters with their built-in thermostats all the way up and their switches on the 6000W setting, running off a single 24V transformer and Hunter 429999B thermostat, with a contactor near each heater switching the 240V AC on and off.  If I\'m not in the building I keep the thermostat at its minimum 45 degrees setting to prevent pipes from freezing.  Using a contactor, you\'re essentially automating turning the heater on and off, no different than using the instruction manual\'s method of using the circuit breaker, and not voiding any warranty.This is not an infrared heater, the manufacturer calls itself both Dr. Heater and Dr. Infrared Heater.  The heater is a wire coil type, the front two coils are 1500 watts each tied together, the rear coil is a single 3000 watt for a total of 6000 watts.  With the fan blowing on them, a spiral or two of the rear coil may get red, primarily near the coil supports.  If the fan doesn\'t turn the coil will get red hot, and probably break the support wire inside and then droop.  I received one heater that had a bent fan bracket not allowing the blade to turn and when powered up the rear coil did just that.  I received a refund to buy a third heater and since the vendor was filing a damage claim, was told to discard the defective heater if after 10 days the shipping carrier didn\'t contact me to inspect it.  After the 10 days passed without being contacted, I straightened the bracket out, verified the fan worked and then adjusted the drooping rear coil so there was a minimum of red spots.  I ended up with 3 heaters for the price of 2.Although the output of the heaters may feel like no more than a hand held hair dryer when your area is cold, follow the instruction manual\'s recommendations of keeping it the proper distances from walls and other objects.  If you feel it isn\'t putting out like it should, use a clamp-on ammeter to verify the heater is drawing around 25A on each leg with the temperature control fully clockwise and the switch on 6000W.  If it\'s not, contact the vendor.I have a 30x50 pole barn shop with a 10\' ceiling, so the roof peak is about 12\'.  It has ""double bubble foil"" insulation on the walls and roof, with exposed trusses.  The heater\'s manual recommends 1.25 watts of heating per cubic foot, so 30\' x 50\' x 11\' x 1.25W = 20,625 watts.  With 18,000W of heaters, I can set the thermostat at 60, go to the home store 10 miles away and by the time I get back the heaters have shut off.  If I already have my materials and I\'m in a hurry to get started, I supplement the electrics with a 3-burner 45,000 BTU tank-mounted propane heater to raise the temp to 60 faster.  So a single 6000W heater in an uninsulated 3-car garage may not be adequate.Before I contacted the eBay vendor about the damaged heater, I contacted the Dr. Heater by phone.  They told me they would send a replacement heater and pre-paid shipping label.  Then I received an email stating they would email me a label within one business day and start the replacement process.  I never received the label by email.  When I called Dr. Heater on the second business day they said they would email a label by the end of the day.  I never got that, so I resolved the issue with the eBay vendor, a 10 star solution.  So it may not be worth the stamp to send in your warranty card.  If you get a working unit, it\'s worth the money.  Good luck repairing one later, since parts don\'t seem to be available.  Due to one of mine having a bent fan bracket, if you get a DR-966 in the 160014xx serial number range, stick a screwdriver in the back and try to spin the fan blade before installation.  A pallet of these might have gotten dropped on the dock after coming off a ship from China.  If that bracket was bent before the heater was assembled, then don\'t trust the QC sticker on the back. It hasn\'t got to zero outside yet, and I haven\'t got my first electric bill, so I may be in for a shock in that respect.', ""It's an OK heater. You MUST user the heavy 8 gauge wire and the 35 amp circuit breakers that the instructions say. It has a much quieter fan than my old one, so that's a really nice thing. Puts out a good amount of heat for a small heater. So Great so far? The only bad thing that I have to say about it, is the same as a couple other reviews. The thermostat just doesn't work right. It turns on at 65 degrees and cycles on and off like you would expect. But during the day it keeps turning on more and more warming up the shop by turning on at higher and higher temps. By the end of the day it was turning on at 79 degrees and this was with the thermostat not being moved, set the same all day long. So if it had a better thermostat it would easily be a 5 Star heater. Better yet a remote mounted thermostat would be Great! Heats up my well insulated shop 20X16X8 even when it dropped to zero outside. So it's a GREAT heater with a crappy thermostat.         "", 'Installed this heater on a 20 degree day in a dairy milk house ( block building). It had that space up 65 degrees in 20 minutes.This was at the full 6000 watts. Then left the thermostat at 3/4. This was adequate for me. Maybe 70 degrees at full power? A really quality unit for price!', '1000 square foot shop stays warm when it’s 30 degrees outside. I keep the temp about 58 to 60 when working. Any warmer and it’s not comfortable. Fairly quite on high.  Great value on a heater. Propane was costly and dangerous in a shop using flammable liquids. ', 'I got this as an open box, but looks brand new.  Got it for a great price.  I have it on a 30 amp breaker with #10 wire.  Seems to work very well with no issues.', 'Nice heater for its size...Puts out a fair amount of heat.Will probably consume a fair amount of electricity if my calculations are right', ""This is a well built product at a reasonable price. It is easy to install. It cycles properly and maintains the temperature in my 24'X24' garage. I was expecting more fan noise but it is fairly  quiet."", 'Its a good product for the money', 'Does a good job heating my garage/wood shop.Some mentioned a need to upgrade the electrical capacity. I have a 30 amp breaker with #10 gauge wire. Recommendations are 8 gauge with a 35 amp breaker.I decided to check the amp load of the heater before upgrading. I wired it up and put my clamp meter on both legs at high power. Reading was 21-22 amps per leg. 10 gauge wire is rated for 30 amps. I now run the heater on low when not present in the shop. I switch to high only when I’m in the shop if necessary.No problems at all. Puts out the heat when I need it.Anyway, I do plan on upgrading wiring and breaker when the weather warms up.Good heater, good price.', ""Heater  works great.

BROAN Electric Radiant Ceiling Heater 157,150.29, ,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation. The power to the heater tested good.', ""Love this little heater, just renivating my Mum's home.   It's so nice to have this little heater in the basement bath.  Very reasonable in price and a nice touch!!!"", 'Brand new unused, unopened.  Excellent purchase. ', 'The Broan 157 ceiling heater is a great upgrade from the "" twisted wire element "" heater.

Mr. Heater Big Buddy Portable 18000 BTU Heater - Red,, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Dr. Heater DR966 240-volt Hardwired Shop or Home Garage Commercial Heater,152.0, ,"['The heater requires a 35A circuit with #8AWG wire per Article 424 of the National Electric Code. The heater only pulls 25A on highest setting, but is considered a ""fixed"" device with a ""continuous load"", so the wiring and breaker need to be rated at 125%.  That puts it at 31.25A, over a #10AWG wire and 30A breaker\'s rating.  Don\'t risk your insurance company denying your claim if something goes wrong.At that power, you don\'t want to use a line voltage thermostat designed for smaller baseboard heaters.  If you want a wall mounted thermostat, look into any conventional thermostat, a 24VAC HVAC transformer, and a 40A 2-pole 24V HVAC contactor.  I have three DR-966 heaters with their built-in thermostats all the way up and their switches on the 6000W setting, running off a single 24V transformer and Hunter 429999B thermostat, with a contactor near each heater switching the 240V AC on and off.  If I\'m not in the building I keep the thermostat at its minimum 45 degrees setting to prevent pipes from freezing.  Using a contactor, you\'re essentially automating turning the heater on and off, no different than using the instruction manual\'s method of using the circuit breaker, and not voiding any warranty.This is not an infrared heater, the manufacturer calls itself both Dr. Heater and Dr. Infrared Heater.  The heater is a wire coil type, the front two coils are 1500 watts each tied together, the rear coil is a single 3000 watt for a total of 6000 watts.  With the fan blowing on them, a spiral or two of the rear coil may get red, primarily near the coil supports.  If the fan doesn\'t turn the coil will get red hot, and probably break the support wire inside and then droop.  I received one heater that had a bent fan bracket not allowing the blade to turn and when powered up the rear coil did just that.  I received a refund to buy a third heater and since the vendor was filing a damage claim, was told to discard the defective heater if after 10 days the shipping carrier didn\'t contact me to inspect it.  After the 10 days passed without being contacted, I straightened the bracket out, verified the fan worked and then adjusted the drooping rear coil so there was a minimum of red spots.  I ended up with 3 heaters for the price of 2.Although the output of the heaters may feel like no more than a hand held hair dryer when your area is cold, follow the instruction manual\'s recommendations of keeping it the proper distances from walls and other objects.  If you feel it isn\'t putting out like it should, use a clamp-on ammeter to verify the heater is drawing around 25A on each leg with the temperature control fully clockwise and the switch on 6000W.  If it\'s not, contact the vendor.I have a 30x50 pole barn shop with a 10\' ceiling, so the roof peak is about 12\'.  It has ""double bubble foil"" insulation on the walls and roof, with exposed trusses.  The heater\'s manual recommends 1.25 watts of heating per cubic foot, so 30\' x 50\' x 11\' x 1.25W = 20,625 watts.  With 18,000W of heaters, I can set the thermostat at 60, go to the home store 10 miles away and by the time I get back the heaters have shut off.  If I already have my materials and I\'m in a hurry to get started, I supplement the electrics with a 3-burner 45,000 BTU tank-mounted propane heater to raise the temp to 60 faster.  So a single 6000W heater in an uninsulated 3-car garage may not be adequate.Before I contacted the eBay vendor about the damaged heater, I contacted the Dr. Heater by phone.  They told me they would send a replacement heater and pre-paid shipping label.  Then I received an email stating they would email me a label within one business day and start the replacement process.  I never received the label by email.  When I called Dr. Heater on the second business day they said they would email a label by the end of the day.  I never got that, so I resolved the issue with the eBay vendor, a 10 star solution.  So it may not be worth the stamp to send in your warranty card.  If you get a working unit, it\'s worth the money.  Good luck repairing one later, since parts don\'t seem to be available.  Due to one of mine having a bent fan bracket, if you get a DR-966 in the 160014xx serial number range, stick a screwdriver in the back and try to spin the fan blade before installation.  A pallet of these might have gotten dropped on the dock after coming off a ship from China.  If that bracket was bent before the heater was assembled, then don\'t trust the QC sticker on the back. It hasn\'t got to zero outside yet, and I haven\'t got my first electric bill, so I may be in for a shock in that respect.', ""It's an OK heater. You MUST user the heavy 8 gauge wire and the 35 amp circuit breakers that the instructions say. It has a much quieter fan than my old one, so that's a really nice thing. Puts out a good amount of heat for a small heater. So Great so far? The only bad thing that I have to say about it, is the same as a couple other reviews. The thermostat just doesn't work right. It turns on at 65 degrees and cycles on and off like you would expect. But during the day it keeps turning on more and more warming up the shop by turning on at higher and higher temps. By the end of the day it was turning on at 79 degrees and this was with the thermostat not being moved, set the same all day long. So if it had a better thermostat it would easily be a 5 Star heater. Better yet a remote mounted thermostat would be Great! Heats up my well insulated shop 20X16X8 even when it dropped to zero outside. So it's a GREAT heater with a crappy thermostat.         "", 'Installed this heater on a 20 degree day in a dairy milk house ( block building). It had that space up 65 degrees in 20 minutes.This was at the full 6000 watts. Then left the thermostat at 3/4. This was adequate for me. Maybe 70 degrees at full power? A really quality unit for price!', '1000 square foot shop stays warm when it’s 30 degrees outside. I keep the temp about 58 to 60 when working. Any warmer and it’s not comfortable. Fairly quite on high.  Great value on a heater. Propane was costly and dangerous in a shop using flammable liquids. ', 'I got this as an open box, but looks brand new.  Got it for a great price.  I have it on a 30 amp breaker with #10 wire.  Seems to work very well with no issues.', 'Nice heater for its size...Puts out a fair amount of heat.Will probably consume a fair amount of electricity if my calculations are right', ""This is a well built product at a reasonable price. It is easy to install. It cycles properly and maintains the temperature in my 24'X24' garage. I was expecting more fan noise but it is fairly  quiet."", 'Its a good product for the money', 'Does a good job heating my garage/wood shop.Some mentioned a need to upgrade the electrical capacity. I have a 30 amp breaker with #10 gauge wire. Recommendations are 8 gauge with a 35 amp breaker.I decided to check the amp load of the heater before upgrading. I wired it up and put my clamp meter on both legs at high power. Reading was 21-22 amps per leg. 10 gauge wire is rated for 30 amps. I now run the heater on low when not present in the shop. I switch to high only when I’m in the shop if necessary.No problems at all. Puts out the heat when I need it.Anyway, I do plan on upgrading wiring and breaker when the weather warms up.Good heater, good price.', ""Heater  works great.

BROAN Electric Radiant Ceiling Heater 157,150.29, ,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation. The power to the heater tested good.', ""Love this little heater, just renivating my Mum's home.   It's so nice to have this little heater in the basement bath.  Very reasonable in price and a nice touch!!!"", 'Brand new unused, unopened.  Excellent purchase. ', 'The Broan 157 ceiling heater is a great upgrade from the "" twisted wire element "" heater.

Comfort Zone Electric Heater Furnace Safety Overheat Protection Ceiling Mount,158.94,30-day returns,"[""easy install, seems to be made well.  love the three heat settingsall parts were present and was packaged well. upon install, turned on power, turned thermostat knob and bam...had instant heat as I had expected...bring on the cold!!.however, one feature that I wish it had was a delayed fan off to cool the heating coils after use. when you rotate the thermostat knob, the fan shuts down immediately, leaving the hot coils to cool off too slowly. also, the unit I received didn't have a visible mark on the thermostat knob for easy identification of position (easily fixed). overall, nice product for the money"", ""So much easier than installing a gas furnace and vent.  Fan creates a full circular heat draft all the way around my 20x20 detached garage.  Heats up quickly and I can then turn it down.  Thermostat works well.  I had a 30 amp welder plug in a good location, so mounted it on the ceiling and used a 10' dryer plug cord.  Quick and easy installation.  Should have done this years ago.  No more freezing with a little space heater."", 'I recommend knowledgäble HVAC guy to add the external thermostat if you need one.  I have high ceilings and wanted to use my mouting system that âttaches to the walls in a corner - no ceiling holes, but two nights of engineering the aluminum mounts.  Hester has been set on low since I installed it and let the Honeywell electronic thermostât do the work.  Waiting for ã heating bill to begin tuning it for optimãl settings depending on weather.  But garage can get hot it works so well.', ""I purchased this heater to use in a 666 sq ft, 4-car, uninsulated, vaulted ceiling garage.  Obviously this is meant to be used in a smaller, more insulated setting.  I wanted to try just one first, and then add as necessary.The heater itself seems to be well-built as far as structure, and designed well as far as installation and operation.  Including running wiring and building a wall mount (vaulted ceiling so no ceiling studs), it took 2-3hrs to get up and running.In my large uninsulated setting, over the course of 3-4hrs, it was able to raise the temperature from 25*F to 45*F, roughly speaking.  In other words, from intolerable to tolerable.  Which is about what I expected from it.  I think it would do quite well at maintaining a higher temperature if I were to use my propane 'salamander' to initially heat the space.Based on other's reviews and my own experience, there seems to be a major quality control concern in the assembly line for these regarding the fan nut.  I was unaware of this until after it was installed, but I'm almost certain I have the same issue as almost everyone else.  Before mounting the heater there was a nut and washer rattling around inside.  After a semi-thorough check, I figured it was an erroneous leftover.  Having read the reviews and after hearing a small rattle when the heater runs, I will be dismounting and tearing it down to install that nut properly.  This is both an inconvenience and really a potential danger.  For that I've removed a star from the rating.That being said, I will be purchasing another one, possibly two more.  Can't beat the price to performance ratio anywhere.Edit from the future:  I bought another one, slightly updated since the first.  This one had no problems and even runs quieter.  Awesome."", ""This heater does a great job heating my 24'x30' insulated shop. I have it on a Honeywell line thermostat, and typically keep it at 40* to keep water lines from freezing, but when I'm ready to work in the ship I just turn it up and in 20 minutes it's nice and toasty. The other day it was 30* outside, but on high this ran for less than 5 minutes every 20-30 minutes.The only potential negative to be aware of is that it has a slight whistle when it's running. It's enough that I think about it every time it starts up, but it's not enough to be a nuisance.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase; it was easy to install, and is cost-effective for the job I needed it to do."", ""Fast shipping.Well packaged.All metal construction.Enough detail in instructions,easily installed,best of all:heater works great.No issues so far.I heat a decent size 2 car garage and this is all I need.Recomend a ceiling fan to force the heat down,same thing with all of 'em.I can not stand beneath this heater when it is on high,it is way beyond my expectations.It is not very big or impressive,but do not let that part fool ya,it is a good heater.I have left the thermostat inside the heater,so far this is working fine."", 'I have used 4 times now and I really like it. If you have a insulated two car garage this heater will do the job nicely.It only took about 30 minutes to go from 30° to  62° in an hour it was 71° had to turn it down to work though. I like it 57° to 63° when working on a project. This heater is perfect for my needs. Little less than $100 too!👍', ""I'm happy with this heater and wish I'd found it years ago. I installed it in my basement workshop and it is way better than the big baseboard heater and kerosene heater I'd been using for many years. It's quiet and easy to install and heats the basement better than I'd anticipated. The workmanship and quality are great and I especially like that the sheet metal parts are post painted as opposed to crummy pre-paint and so all the sheet metal cut edges and corners are painted and nice and smooth and burr free."", 'I use this heater turned down low just to knock the edge off the cold so I can work comfortably in my 3 car garage shop.  I have it set on about 1/3 of its capacity and it keeps the garage at about 55- 60, the way I like it.  If I were to turn it up on high it would make the garage toasty warm.  The installation was straight forward and simple.  I bought a plug, 15 ft. of 10-3 service cord and a cord grip to make the installation. I plug it into my 220 volt welder receptacle when I want to have heat.  Wish I had found it years ago.', 'Great heat output, replaced my floor oil heater and small plug in with this one.  Only reason I gave it a 4 not 5 is that # 1 the fan blade was loose when I got it and the simple mechanism makes a rattling noise that is not necessary.

The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.

And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.

I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill.

It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.

I can use my RV propane tanks, so the only extras I had to buy was a regulator and connector hose.  It puts out pretty good heat, and my CO detector doesn't go off.

Additionally, if I don't open a window or crack a door, within 2 hours it depletes the oxygen in the room to the point it shuts down.  The oxygen gets so low my propane torch won't fire up.

Installed a Mr. Heater regulator on the tank end of the pipe, a Mr. Heater shut off valve and flex pipe at the heater end.I also bought and installed the optional fan for it however the it dosent turn on when you set it to auto. But constant on is ok. The temp settings seem to work fine on the heater itself though, when I put the control knob on 1, 2, 3, or 4 it shuts down and fires back up when the temp gets to those levels, I don't know what those temps actually are but on setting 5 it runs contignously."", 'This is one of the best purchases I\'ve made.

I'm Happy "", ""Yes hello I've tested this product as a backup heater for my home I live in California where they threaten to shut off our power supply and I believe it will be adequate for heating my home I like it. At a constant burn it's about 1 gallon / 3 hours."", 'I\'ve had one of these heater at a remote cabin where the nighttime temperatures sometime are 23F many times during the winter.  This model does a superb job of heating the entire cabin without having to turn it up above ""medium"".It is easy to use and I\'ve had for ten years without any need for maintenance. I bought an extra heater for another location.  I highly recommend this unit.', ""This was the cheapest solution(sale $155.00) instead of me adding a fire place. With generator, gas or wood burning stove costing significantly more. My goal was two fold, heat up my connected 2 car garage when i work on my never quite finished project car, and have heat forbmy house just in case a power outage occurs. A week after I purchased the heater. During a minus 5 degree night, my old boiler goes out at 3 am. So Mr heater is brought to my living room and the boiler contracting company says they are experiencing heavy call volume an d doesn't know when a technician will be able to Get to there but it's within 24hrs. Long story short, 3 1/2 20gallon propane tanks over 27 hours from outage to boiler being fixed. My house was kept warm and no pipes froze.

Lasko 5572 Room Heater,157.26,30-day returns,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater. And If I have to replace any one of the heaters I have, it will be with a Lasko 5572 heater.HJ of Missouri', ""We were absolutely thrilled with the size and capability of this room heater.

I bought the second one because one of our tenants lost the remote.  One is #5165, the other one is #755320, the only complaint I have on this model is I had to stick a piece of foam tale on the top of the carrying slot in back so my finger wouldn't slip out of the carrying slot when carrying the heater.  The other heater's slot is angled so your fingers don't slip out.  The one remote does control either heater.  I recommended my satisfaction to a friend and he bought one and is happy with it.

Dr. Heater DR966 240-volt Hardwired Shop Garage Commercial Heater ,159.99,30-day returns,"['The heater requires a 35A circuit with #8AWG wire per Article 424 of the National Electric Code. The heater only pulls 25A on highest setting, but is considered a ""fixed"" device with a ""continuous load"", so the wiring and breaker need to be rated at 125%.  That puts it at 31.25A, over a #10AWG wire and 30A breaker\'s rating.  Don\'t risk your insurance company denying your claim if something goes wrong.At that power, you don\'t want to use a line voltage thermostat designed for smaller baseboard heaters.  If you want a wall mounted thermostat, look into any conventional thermostat, a 24VAC HVAC transformer, and a 40A 2-pole 24V HVAC contactor.  I have three DR-966 heaters with their built-in thermostats all the way up and their switches on the 6000W setting, running off a single 24V transformer and Hunter 429999B thermostat, with a contactor near each heater switching the 240V AC on and off.  If I\'m not in the building I keep the thermostat at its minimum 45 degrees setting to prevent pipes from freezing.  Using a contactor, you\'re essentially automating turning the heater on and off, no different than using the instruction manual\'s method of using the circuit breaker, and not voiding any warranty.This is not an infrared heater, the manufacturer calls itself both Dr. Heater and Dr. Infrared Heater.  The heater is a wire coil type, the front two coils are 1500 watts each tied together, the rear coil is a single 3000 watt for a total of 6000 watts.  With the fan blowing on them, a spiral or two of the rear coil may get red, primarily near the coil supports.  If the fan doesn\'t turn the coil will get red hot, and probably break the support wire inside and then droop.  I received one heater that had a bent fan bracket not allowing the blade to turn and when powered up the rear coil did just that.  I received a refund to buy a third heater and since the vendor was filing a damage claim, was told to discard the defective heater if after 10 days the shipping carrier didn\'t contact me to inspect it.  After the 10 days passed without being contacted, I straightened the bracket out, verified the fan worked and then adjusted the drooping rear coil so there was a minimum of red spots.  I ended up with 3 heaters for the price of 2.Although the output of the heaters may feel like no more than a hand held hair dryer when your area is cold, follow the instruction manual\'s recommendations of keeping it the proper distances from walls and other objects.  If you feel it isn\'t putting out like it should, use a clamp-on ammeter to verify the heater is drawing around 25A on each leg with the temperature control fully clockwise and the switch on 6000W.  If it\'s not, contact the vendor.I have a 30x50 pole barn shop with a 10\' ceiling, so the roof peak is about 12\'.  It has ""double bubble foil"" insulation on the walls and roof, with exposed trusses.  The heater\'s manual recommends 1.25 watts of heating per cubic foot, so 30\' x 50\' x 11\' x 1.25W = 20,625 watts.  With 18,000W of heaters, I can set the thermostat at 60, go to the home store 10 miles away and by the time I get back the heaters have shut off.  If I already have my materials and I\'m in a hurry to get started, I supplement the electrics with a 3-burner 45,000 BTU tank-mounted propane heater to raise the temp to 60 faster.  So a single 6000W heater in an uninsulated 3-car garage may not be adequate.Before I contacted the eBay vendor about the damaged heater, I contacted the Dr. Heater by phone.  They told me they would send a replacement heater and pre-paid shipping label.  Then I received an email stating they would email me a label within one business day and start the replacement process.  I never received the label by email.  When I called Dr. Heater on the second business day they said they would email a label by the end of the day.  I never got that, so I resolved the issue with the eBay vendor, a 10 star solution.  So it may not be worth the stamp to send in your warranty card.  If you get a working unit, it\'s worth the money.  Good luck repairing one later, since parts don\'t seem to be available.  Due to one of mine having a bent fan bracket, if you get a DR-966 in the 160014xx serial number range, stick a screwdriver in the back and try to spin the fan blade before installation.  A pallet of these might have gotten dropped on the dock after coming off a ship from China.  If that bracket was bent before the heater was assembled, then don\'t trust the QC sticker on the back. It hasn\'t got to zero outside yet, and I haven\'t got my first electric bill, so I may be in for a shock in that respect.', ""It's an OK heater. You MUST user the heavy 8 gauge wire and the 35 amp circuit breakers that the instructions say. It has a much quieter fan than my old one, so that's a really nice thing. Puts out a good amount of heat for a small heater. So Great so far? The only bad thing that I have to say about it, is the same as a couple other reviews. The thermostat just doesn't work right. It turns on at 65 degrees and cycles on and off like you would expect. But during the day it keeps turning on more and more warming up the shop by turning on at higher and higher temps. By the end of the day it was turning on at 79 degrees and this was with the thermostat not being moved, set the same all day long. So if it had a better thermostat it would easily be a 5 Star heater. Better yet a remote mounted thermostat would be Great! Heats up my well insulated shop 20X16X8 even when it dropped to zero outside. So it's a GREAT heater with a crappy thermostat.         "", 'Installed this heater on a 20 degree day in a dairy milk house ( block building). It had that space up 65 degrees in 20 minutes.This was at the full 6000 watts. Then left the thermostat at 3/4. This was adequate for me. Maybe 70 degrees at full power? A really quality unit for price!', '1000 square foot shop stays warm when it’s 30 degrees outside. I keep the temp about 58 to 60 when working. Any warmer and it’s not comfortable. Fairly quite on high.  Great value on a heater. Propane was costly and dangerous in a shop using flammable liquids. ', 'I got this as an open box, but looks brand new.  Got it for a great price.  I have it on a 30 amp breaker with #10 wire.  Seems to work very well with no issues.', 'Nice heater for its size...Puts out a fair amount of heat.Will probably consume a fair amount of electricity if my calculations are right', ""This is a well built product at a reasonable price. It is easy to install. It cycles properly and maintains the temperature in my 24'X24' garage. I was expecting more fan noise but it is fairly  quiet."", 'Its a good product for the money', 'Does a good job heating my garage/wood shop.Some mentioned a need to upgrade the electrical capacity. I have a 30 amp breaker with #10 gauge wire. Recommendations are 8 gauge with a 35 amp breaker.I decided to check the amp load of the heater before upgrading. I wired it up and put my clamp meter on both legs at high power. Reading was 21-22 amps per leg. 10 gauge wire is rated for 30 amps. I now run the heater on low when not present in the shop. I switch to high only when I’m in the shop if necessary.No problems at all. Puts out the heat when I need it.Anyway, I do plan on upgrading wiring and breaker when the weather warms up.Good heater, good price.', ""Heater  works great.

New LASKO 760000 Ceramic Heater w Remote,158.63, ,"[""this little heater will heat your small room to a toasty comfort level in just minutes, with the remote control everything is a snap and no need to get out of your seat, it is that easy to use, it's compact so it fits anywhere in a room giving you space, this product was a really good price,"", ""I love this heater. My wife dragged me to Lowe's to by a heater. I told her that we should buy a ceramic heater instead of a infrared heater. But like always she didn't want to listen. We ended up buying a heater for 150. This heater looks like old cast iron heater and it takes like an hour to make a room comfy. BBUUUUTTTT this Lasko heater is the BOMB and very worth it."", ""Works like a champ.  This heats my 250 square foot garage that is like an ice cube, otherwise.  I really like the thermostat feature.  I've had two of these in the past, and they have always worked well."", ""We have a small house in s.e. mich.. about 700 sq. ft. on the main level.  several years ago our furnace quit and we've been using ceramic heaters ever since.  I bought this lasco heater this fall to see if it could do better than the previous heater and it has been keeping the wholehouseat about 66 to 68 degrees so far.  Right now we are having the coldest below zero weather in years and it is still keeping things at around 60 with no other heater. needless to say, we have turned on an additional ceramic heater and the temp in the living room isaround 65. I repeat we have no other furnace or heater in the housethe basement stays around 60 all the time but as soon as the outdoors temps rise into the 20's and 30's it will be about 68 in here and we will only need the large Lasco heater.I am very happy with this heater."", 'Works well and looks like the picture, but not quite the remote I was looking for.  I understand the remote that actually went with my upright fan, the model is now out of date or for sale.', 'I plugged the space heaters in immediately and it took the chill right off the house love them. I have a heat pump and when the temperature gets below 32 the system needs help. These are perfect.', 'Quiet; Very powerful; Many fan &amp; heat speed/temperature options. Delivered much faster than even my dog\'s favorite (E-bay) dog food! The back of this unit is not even the slightest bit warm, even when temperature and fan speed are at ""max""! Greatly helps supplement our home\'s central heat, even during extremely cold weather.', ""This heater warms my apartment way better than the heating sytem for the apartment. It's easy to move around and it does not get hot so you can move it without the danger of getting burned bu holding the sides. Good choice for anyone who has to use gas heat or heat a lot. Could save you a lot of money."", 'Actually, my 5/6 year old unit is STILL GOOD. but the remote died from battery corrosion.So, I now have TWO GOOD EXCELLENT HEATERS- with One REMOTE. * works on both👍🏻', ""This heater provides a great deal of heat for a large room/ recommend it for purchase, if a person is interested a quality heater.....it's well worth the investment/ Thank you.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

 10 pc American Wick AW-500 Kerosene Heater Wick Fits Many Perfection Models NEW,159.99,37 sold,"['I got these wicks for my antique Perfection kerosene heaters (I bought several more to keep on hand after trying two). In my opinion, this wick actually out-performs the (new old stock) Perfection Brand wicks available for sale, which can be smelly from age, sometimes bent or rusted, and the cotton wick material, itself, tends to be a bit stiff from age, and occasionally are reconditioned or simply moved in the carrier to appear to be new when they are, in fact, used. I\'ve had that result twice from buying ""new"" old stock Perfection Brand wicks. This American Wick AW-500 fits perfectly, works smoothly, and is made with superior materials and craftsmanship. The wick is all cotton, heavy-duty and is long-lasting. It\'s clean-burning and there is no smoke or odor. The steel wick carrier is sturdy and smooth. Unlike the Perfection Brand wick, the American AW-500 is constructed with 4 splits in the lower part which go into the tank, creating 4 ""tails"" (NOTE: The lower portion of the wick is not visible in photo, as they are tucked inside its own cylindrical carrier in packaging, and in the photo). The American Wick AW-500 wick is very similar to the Perfection Brand 500 wick, but the Perfection  wick is split in 2 places and has 2 tails. In my opinion, the American AW-500 wick with 4 tails works better and is easier to install, because the 4-way tail split allows the wick tales to be more easily maneuvered around the wick adjuster, to seat a bit lower when turned down, and the tails to dip deeper into the kerosene tank and are more neatly adjusted up and down without binding at all. The cost of this item is very reasonable and I think it\'s a great value, compared with the usually higher-priced original Perfection 500 wicks to be found for sale. I hesitated at first to buy this non-Perfection part for my Perfection heaters, but after a couple of bad experiences with the more costly Perfection wicks, I am so glad I took the chance and bought the American AW-500 wicks! I\'m extremely pleased! I highly recommend this excellent product! ', ""These are not very heavy weight, the weave is loose, and they are not even close to the high quality brand name wick I order from England.  Cosmetically it's not nice looking as an original Perfection wick . Heavy metal wick sleeve is good and they are nicely fastened with metal riveting. They will work just fine in a Perfection 500 heater they just don't last as long as the other brand I buy and they will burn down a little bit faster.  If I can get a good deal on an AW-500 wick or this is the only one available it is much better than a fiberglass wick. Just make sure that you are gentle installing the wick and if one gets a lot of tar from contaminated fuel, moisture,  improper use,  and sticky in the wick gallery these will tear. Odor wise they will smell terrible when you burn one in for the first time that is normal because they are not pre charred. If you run at the highest flame setting possible in the Perfection 500  heater burning good quality kerosene they will do a good job. I use a Perfection 500 heater burning clear kerosene every day year round as my only source of heat and for cooking? If I can get a good deal on one or more of these AW500 wicks I will buy them.   "", 'Excellent quality.  AW-45 is lower part of a mechanical wick; AW-40 is the top part only; AW-49 is both top and bottom.  AW-45, as the bottom only, appears to be no longer available from wick manufacturers.  Grab them if you can find them!', 'Fits just as it should. Burns great in my Perfection M525 Heater. Will definitely buy again, although this one will last me for a few years.', 'Much better quality wick than even more expense wicks out there.  This one burns like the OEM all cotton wick with normal  charring as it should.  Other wicks I have used seem to have a high percentage of nylon or other synthetic and leave a hard residue after just one or two burns that is then hard to relight.  This wick has none of that and I will buy buy another just to have one hand. ', ""I was skeptical to purchase at first, considering they don't manufacture the Perfection Heaters anymore, but I took a chance and was very happy this wick is quite similar to an original Perfection wick, and it's 100% cotton. The only issue I experienced was that the gear holes on the wick canister didn't exactly line up correctly. Fortunately I was able to transfer the wick to the original wick canister which has gear holes all around it, making it much easier to install."", 'I had to get another one because it had burned down. When I forget to turn off the heater, the wick will burn down one quarter of an inch each time. I probably will be ordering another soon. Thanks for the product and price.', 'Heater is 100yrs. old, was easy to install,glad wick was still available.', 'These were great! I have two 50 year old vintage kerosene heater and these worked out perfectly!! I highly recommend these!', ""The next best thing to the 'Perfection' brand wick. Second one I bought.

" F274805 18,000 BTU Big Buddy Portable Heater",159.59,30-day returns,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Dr Infrared Heater Portable Space Heater, 1500-Watt",157.59,30-day returns,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit. Doesn't even look like a heater, more like a piece of furniture or a speaker for a high end stereo system."", 'I hen purchase several brands of infrared heaters .   Dr. Heater is built solid .  Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.  Am not able to determine if I am saving money on this product or not running it continuously versus other types of heating methods.  Product works well - happy so far.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Dr Infrared Heater Portable Space Heater, 1500-Watt",157.29,30-day returns,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit. Doesn't even look like a heater, more like a piece of furniture or a speaker for a high end stereo system."", 'I hen purchase several brands of infrared heaters .   Dr. Heater is built solid .  Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.  Am not able to determine if I am saving money on this product or not running it continuously versus other types of heating methods.

17065 BTU Ceiling Mount Fan-Forced Industrial Utility Electric Heater Furnace,157.59, ,"[""easy install, seems to be made well.  love the three heat settingsall parts were present and was packaged well. upon install, turned on power, turned thermostat knob and bam...had instant heat as I had expected...bring on the cold!!.however, one feature that I wish it had was a delayed fan off to cool the heating coils after use. when you rotate the thermostat knob, the fan shuts down immediately, leaving the hot coils to cool off too slowly. also, the unit I received didn't have a visible mark on the thermostat knob for easy identification of position (easily fixed). overall, nice product for the money"", ""So much easier than installing a gas furnace and vent.  Fan creates a full circular heat draft all the way around my 20x20 detached garage.  Heats up quickly and I can then turn it down.  Thermostat works well.  I had a 30 amp welder plug in a good location, so mounted it on the ceiling and used a 10' dryer plug cord.  Quick and easy installation.  Should have done this years ago.  No more freezing with a little space heater."", 'I recommend knowledgäble HVAC guy to add the external thermostat if you need one.  I have high ceilings and wanted to use my mouting system that âttaches to the walls in a corner - no ceiling holes, but two nights of engineering the aluminum mounts.  Hester has been set on low since I installed it and let the Honeywell electronic thermostât do the work.  Waiting for ã heating bill to begin tuning it for optimãl settings depending on weather.  But garage can get hot it works so well.', ""I purchased this heater to use in a 666 sq ft, 4-car, uninsulated, vaulted ceiling garage.  Obviously this is meant to be used in a smaller, more insulated setting.  I wanted to try just one first, and then add as necessary.The heater itself seems to be well-built as far as structure, and designed well as far as installation and operation.  Including running wiring and building a wall mount (vaulted ceiling so no ceiling studs), it took 2-3hrs to get up and running.In my large uninsulated setting, over the course of 3-4hrs, it was able to raise the temperature from 25*F to 45*F, roughly speaking.  In other words, from intolerable to tolerable.  Which is about what I expected from it.  I think it would do quite well at maintaining a higher temperature if I were to use my propane 'salamander' to initially heat the space.Based on other's reviews and my own experience, there seems to be a major quality control concern in the assembly line for these regarding the fan nut.  I was unaware of this until after it was installed, but I'm almost certain I have the same issue as almost everyone else.  Before mounting the heater there was a nut and washer rattling around inside.  After a semi-thorough check, I figured it was an erroneous leftover.  Having read the reviews and after hearing a small rattle when the heater runs, I will be dismounting and tearing it down to install that nut properly.  This is both an inconvenience and really a potential danger.  For that I've removed a star from the rating.That being said, I will be purchasing another one, possibly two more.  Can't beat the price to performance ratio anywhere.Edit from the future:  I bought another one, slightly updated since the first.  This one had no problems and even runs quieter.  Awesome."", ""This heater does a great job heating my 24'x30' insulated shop. I have it on a Honeywell line thermostat, and typically keep it at 40* to keep water lines from freezing, but when I'm ready to work in the ship I just turn it up and in 20 minutes it's nice and toasty. The other day it was 30* outside, but on high this ran for less than 5 minutes every 20-30 minutes.The only potential negative to be aware of is that it has a slight whistle when it's running. It's enough that I think about it every time it starts up, but it's not enough to be a nuisance.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase; it was easy to install, and is cost-effective for the job I needed it to do."", ""Fast shipping.Well packaged.All metal construction.Enough detail in instructions,easily installed,best of all:heater works great.No issues so far.I heat a decent size 2 car garage and this is all I need.Recomend a ceiling fan to force the heat down,same thing with all of 'em.I can not stand beneath this heater when it is on high,it is way beyond my expectations.It is not very big or impressive,but do not let that part fool ya,it is a good heater.I have left the thermostat inside the heater,so far this is working fine."", 'I have used 4 times now and I really like it. If you have a insulated two car garage this heater will do the job nicely.It only took about 30 minutes to go from 30° to  62° in an hour it was 71° had to turn it down to work though. I like it 57° to 63° when working on a project. This heater is perfect for my needs. Little less than $100 too!👍', ""I'm happy with this heater and wish I'd found it years ago. I installed it in my basement workshop and it is way better than the big baseboard heater and kerosene heater I'd been using for many years. It's quiet and easy to install and heats the basement better than I'd anticipated. The workmanship and quality are great and I especially like that the sheet metal parts are post painted as opposed to crummy pre-paint and so all the sheet metal cut edges and corners are painted and nice and smooth and burr free."", 'I use this heater turned down low just to knock the edge off the cold so I can work comfortably in my 3 car garage shop.  I have it set on about 1/3 of its capacity and it keeps the garage at about 55- 60, the way I like it.  If I were to turn it up on high it would make the garage toasty warm.  The installation was straight forward and simple.  I bought a plug, 15 ft. of 10-3 service cord and a cord grip to make the installation. I plug it into my 220 volt welder receptacle when I want to have heat.  Wish I had found it years ago.', 'Great heat output, replaced my floor oil heater and small plug in with this one.  Only reason I gave it a 4 not 5 is that # 1 the fan blade was loose when I got it and the simple mechanism makes a rattling noise that is not necessary.  It only has a moving fan part but is kinda noisy.  Heats very well.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Dr Infrared Heater Portable Space Heater, 1500-Watt",157.29,30-day returns,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit. Doesn't even look like a heater, more like a piece of furniture or a speaker for a high end stereo system."", 'I hen purchase several brands of infrared heaters .   Dr. Heater is built solid .  Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.

17065 BTU Ceiling Mount Fan-Forced Industrial Utility Electric Heater Furnace,157.59, ,"[""easy install, seems to be made well.  love the three heat settingsall parts were present and was packaged well. upon install, turned on power, turned thermostat knob and bam...had instant heat as I had expected...bring on the cold!!.however, one feature that I wish it had was a delayed fan off to cool the heating coils after use. when you rotate the thermostat knob, the fan shuts down immediately, leaving the hot coils to cool off too slowly. also, the unit I received didn't have a visible mark on the thermostat knob for easy identification of position (easily fixed). overall, nice product for the money"", ""So much easier than installing a gas furnace and vent.  Fan creates a full circular heat draft all the way around my 20x20 detached garage.  Heats up quickly and I can then turn it down.  Thermostat works well.  I had a 30 amp welder plug in a good location, so mounted it on the ceiling and used a 10' dryer plug cord.  Quick and easy installation.  Should have done this years ago.  No more freezing with a little space heater."", 'I recommend knowledgäble HVAC guy to add the external thermostat if you need one.  I have high ceilings and wanted to use my mouting system that âttaches to the walls in a corner - no ceiling holes, but two nights of engineering the aluminum mounts.  Hester has been set on low since I installed it and let the Honeywell electronic thermostât do the work.  Waiting for ã heating bill to begin tuning it for optimãl settings depending on weather.  But garage can get hot it works so well.', ""I purchased this heater to use in a 666 sq ft, 4-car, uninsulated, vaulted ceiling garage.  Obviously this is meant to be used in a smaller, more insulated setting.  I wanted to try just one first, and then add as necessary.The heater itself seems to be well-built as far as structure, and designed well as far as installation and operation.  Including running wiring and building a wall mount (vaulted ceiling so no ceiling studs), it took 2-3hrs to get up and running.In my large uninsulated setting, over the course of 3-4hrs, it was able to raise the temperature from 25*F to 45*F, roughly speaking.  In other words, from intolerable to tolerable.  Which is about what I expected from it.  I think it would do quite well at maintaining a higher temperature if I were to use my propane 'salamander' to initially heat the space.Based on other's reviews and my own experience, there seems to be a major quality control concern in the assembly line for these regarding the fan nut.  I was unaware of this until after it was installed, but I'm almost certain I have the same issue as almost everyone else.  Before mounting the heater there was a nut and washer rattling around inside.  After a semi-thorough check, I figured it was an erroneous leftover.  Having read the reviews and after hearing a small rattle when the heater runs, I will be dismounting and tearing it down to install that nut properly.  This is both an inconvenience and really a potential danger.  For that I've removed a star from the rating.That being said, I will be purchasing another one, possibly two more.  Can't beat the price to performance ratio anywhere.Edit from the future:  I bought another one, slightly updated since the first.  This one had no problems and even runs quieter.  Awesome."", ""This heater does a great job heating my 24'x30' insulated shop. I have it on a Honeywell line thermostat, and typically keep it at 40* to keep water lines from freezing, but when I'm ready to work in the ship I just turn it up and in 20 minutes it's nice and toasty. The other day it was 30* outside, but on high this ran for less than 5 minutes every 20-30 minutes.The only potential negative to be aware of is that it has a slight whistle when it's running. It's enough that I think about it every time it starts up, but it's not enough to be a nuisance.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase; it was easy to install, and is cost-effective for the job I needed it to do."", ""Fast shipping.Well packaged.All metal construction.Enough detail in instructions,easily installed,best of all:heater works great.No issues so far.I heat a decent size 2 car garage and this is all I need.Recomend a ceiling fan to force the heat down,same thing with all of 'em.I can not stand beneath this heater when it is on high,it is way beyond my expectations.It is not very big or impressive,but do not let that part fool ya,it is a good heater.I have left the thermostat inside the heater,so far this is working fine."", 'I have used 4 times now and I really like it. If you have a insulated two car garage this heater will do the job nicely.It only took about 30 minutes to go from 30° to  62° in an hour it was 71° had to turn it down to work though. I like it 57° to 63° when working on a project. This heater is perfect for my needs. Little less than $100 too!👍', ""I'm happy with this heater and wish I'd found it years ago. I installed it in my basement workshop and it is way better than the big baseboard heater and kerosene heater I'd been using for many years. It's quiet and easy to install and heats the basement better than I'd anticipated. The workmanship and quality are great and I especially like that the sheet metal parts are post painted as opposed to crummy pre-paint and so all the sheet metal cut edges and corners are painted and nice and smooth and burr free."", 'I use this heater turned down low just to knock the edge off the cold so I can work comfortably in my 3 car garage shop.  I have it set on about 1/3 of its capacity and it keeps the garage at about 55- 60, the way I like it.  If I were to turn it up on high it would make the garage toasty warm.  The installation was straight forward and simple.  I bought a plug, 15 ft. of 10-3 service cord and a cord grip to make the installation. I plug it into my 220 volt welder receptacle when I want to have heat.  Wish I had found it years ago.', 'Great heat output, replaced my floor oil heater and small plug in with this one.  Only reason I gave it a 4 not 5 is that # 1 the fan blade was loose when I got it and the simple mechanism makes a rattling noise that is not necessary.

I used Butane and it was amazingly efficient (you feel the heat even with the pilot!

The ability to adjust from 6,000 to 18,000 BTUs makes it perfect. Build quality seems to be adequate. This is really a no brainer.', ""By every measure, this is wonderful heater. This heater quickly heats a 144 sqft room in 3-4 mins when using it at full capacity going from 40F to 70F. Excellent starting with the pilot light and it is easy to move (but the castors are probably not the greatest). At minimum capacity keeps an entire 2000sqft house from going below 62F when it is 22F outside (but this will also be dependent on air allowed in and insulation as well). Unlike electric, this gives off a pleasant infrared light that will heat things it is pointed at. This is quite nice since heated air is lighter than colder air and rises, but a chair or clothing 3-10ft away will warm from the light emissions. You can sit 3 ft away from it and warm your hands as if it was a camp fire from this light. You can also feel the hot air going straight up into the air.  Make sure you keep clear of the grill as in loose clothes or your leg. Also according to directions you are not suppose to leave it on unattended. But, one of the first things we did was roast marshmallows using long metal rods. For s'mores, you can get the perfect golden marshmallow. (even though it's not marketed as a marshmallow toaster).Between medium-to-high quality, portability, cost efficiency, and the shear fact that it paid for itself in less than one month from switching away from heating with electricity, I give it five stars.  "", 'We have heat pumps in our house and on those really cold nights they just don’t do the trick. We got this heater just for a little extra warmth and we have been shocked on how easy and warm it is. I found out that we only need to run it on low because medium and height is way to much.

The representative was more interested in arguing semantics like wind vs. breeze rather than addressing the issue at hand. I was totally frustrated and am totally dissatisfied with this product. I would absolutely NOT recommend this product to anyone who is planning on using it outdoors for any reason.

"Dr Infrared Heater Portable Space Heater, 1500-Watt",164.74,30-day returns,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit. Doesn't even look like a heater, more like a piece of furniture or a speaker for a high end stereo system."", 'I hen purchase several brands of infrared heaters .   Dr. Heater is built solid .  Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.  Am not able to determine if I am saving money on this product or not running it continuously versus other types of heating methods.

I considered the small propane table top heaters but my wife nixed that idea.  The typical outdoor 8 foot high propane heaters would have probably have drawn to much oxygen from the 13\' X 20\' sun room.  As I searched for other heating options, I came across this heater that stored a 20 lb. tank and made it look aesthetically pleasing.  It provides the right amount of heat for various atmospheric conditions!', 'We use the heater to supplement our fuel oil furnace. Works great to give a shot of heat while maintaining an overall lower temperature while we are gone', 'We got the heater shortly before Christmas 2017 here in Texas. Same day it arrived we had a freeze. Heater was installed in a converted barn and temp got up to about 75 in 15min or so. We have been using it for about a week now in below freezing temps with no issues other than it takes a few clicks to get the pilot to light. With all 3 burners going I pointed my temp gun at the front. My gun only goes to 1,000 deg and the heater is over that.', ""Great heater for my garage/workshop.  The heater puts out enough heat to warm up my 24' x x24' garage on a cold winters day (in Michigan).  With it's 3 settings (Lo, Med &amp; Hi) I start on Hi to raise the temp, then I set it to Lo to maintain temp.  I like the idea that the LP tank is built into the heater (instead of a separate tank and extension hose).  It makes the heater easy to roll around the shop and set it where the heat is needed.  I've had no issues with it not starting or operating properly.All in all, this is one great little portable heater.  I'd definitely but it again."", 'It is exactly what we needed.

It works great in the garage even when it was 20 degrees outside. On high, I have to sit about 2 feet away or I start to get too hot. I normally turn it to medium setting once I start getting hot. It takes about 5 minutes to get up to full heat, and very minimum fumes.  I'm still using my first tank of gas! I love this heater!"", 'This heater holds a 20-pound propane tank.

"Broan Fan Forced Ceiling Heater Electric Bath Indoor 1,250 Watt Surface Mount",163.95, ,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation. The power to the heater tested good.', ""Love this little heater, just renivating my Mum's home.   It's so nice to have this little heater in the basement bath.  Very reasonable in price and a nice touch!!!"", 'Brand new unused, unopened.  Excellent purchase. ', 'The Broan 157 ceiling heater is a great upgrade from the "" twisted wire element "" heater.

"Hiland-HLDS01-CGT-Tall Patio Heater, Hammered Bronze Finish ",160.95,30-day returns,"['The heater was quick to put together. Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.  "", 'It came on time.  Easy to put together but the pilot won’t light. Very disappointing! I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.  If I can’t get it to light, I’m returning it.', ""I purchased it couple of years ago, but after couple of time using it, the heater wouldn't turn on!!! I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door. It didn’t come with the bolts for that but no problem a couple small nuts and bolts from my garage and it is awesome!', 'The Items are both working fine so far. My only issue is, one of the items was considerably damaged as you can see in the pictures.', 'Incredible bargain, and very well made. Hot! Hot!

"Dr Infrared Heater Portable Space Heater, 1500-Watt",164.74, ,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit. Doesn't even look like a heater, more like a piece of furniture or a speaker for a high end stereo system."", 'I hen purchase several brands of infrared heaters .   Dr. Heater is built solid .  Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.  Am not able to determine if I am saving money on this product or not running it continuously versus other types of heating methods.

Bladeless Heatr w Remote Ctrl,161.95,30-day returns,"['This heater is great with small children around. I recently purchased this second heater for a second room. My grandchildren were playing in the living room where one of the heaters was on. I popped into the kitchen for a second and when I returned my two year old granddaughter was playing ring a round the heater. She was putting her arm all the way through the ""hole"" in the middle and was not getting burned. No, I don\'t let them play with it, the point being ""if"" they do touch it they don\'t get burned. I believe these heaters are some of the safest on the market for that reason alone. They also perform very well! There is only one negative thing I have to say, when new, these heaters have a burning plastic smell that will make you think it is burning up and will cause you to want to return it. Before you do, put it in the garage, turn it up as hot and as high as it will go and let it run for a day or so. This will ""burn"" off the unpleasant burning plastic smell ""before"" you use it in your house or office.', 'Works great.', 'Works as described', 'Great product.

I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!!

Hiland-HLDS01-CGT-Tall Patio Heater Hammered Bronze Finish,164.25,30-day returns,"['The heater was quick to put together. Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.  "", 'It came on time.  Easy to put together but the pilot won’t light. Very disappointing! I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.  If I can’t get it to light, I’m returning it.', ""I purchased it couple of years ago, but after couple of time using it, the heater wouldn't turn on!!! I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door. It didn’t come with the bolts for that but no problem a couple small nuts and bolts from my garage and it is awesome!', 'The Items are both working fine so far. My only issue is, one of the items was considerably damaged as you can see in the pictures.', 'Incredible bargain, and very well made. Hot! Hot!

Hiland-HLDS01-CGT-Tall Patio Heater Hammered Bronze Finish,164.25,30-day returns,"['The heater was quick to put together. Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by!

I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!!

I have high ceilings and wanted to use my mouting system that âttaches to the walls in a corner - no ceiling holes, but two nights of engineering the aluminum mounts.  Hester has been set on low since I installed it and let the Honeywell electronic thermostât do the work.  Waiting for ã heating bill to begin tuning it for optimãl settings depending on weather.  But garage can get hot it works so well.', ""I purchased this heater to use in a 666 sq ft, 4-car, uninsulated, vaulted ceiling garage.  Obviously this is meant to be used in a smaller, more insulated setting.  I wanted to try just one first, and then add as necessary.The heater itself seems to be well-built as far as structure, and designed well as far as installation and operation.  Including running wiring and building a wall mount (vaulted ceiling so no ceiling studs), it took 2-3hrs to get up and running.In my large uninsulated setting, over the course of 3-4hrs, it was able to raise the temperature from 25*F to 45*F, roughly speaking.  In other words, from intolerable to tolerable.  Which is about what I expected from it.  I think it would do quite well at maintaining a higher temperature if I were to use my propane 'salamander' to initially heat the space.Based on other's reviews and my own experience, there seems to be a major quality control concern in the assembly line for these regarding the fan nut.  I was unaware of this until after it was installed, but I'm almost certain I have the same issue as almost everyone else.  Before mounting the heater there was a nut and washer rattling around inside.  After a semi-thorough check, I figured it was an erroneous leftover.  Having read the reviews and after hearing a small rattle when the heater runs, I will be dismounting and tearing it down to install that nut properly.  This is both an inconvenience and really a potential danger.  For that I've removed a star from the rating.That being said, I will be purchasing another one, possibly two more.  Can't beat the price to performance ratio anywhere.Edit from the future:  I bought another one, slightly updated since the first.  This one had no problems and even runs quieter.  Awesome."", ""This heater does a great job heating my 24'x30' insulated shop. I have it on a Honeywell line thermostat, and typically keep it at 40* to keep water lines from freezing, but when I'm ready to work in the ship I just turn it up and in 20 minutes it's nice and toasty. The other day it was 30* outside, but on high this ran for less than 5 minutes every 20-30 minutes.The only potential negative to be aware of is that it has a slight whistle when it's running. It's enough that I think about it every time it starts up, but it's not enough to be a nuisance.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase; it was easy to install, and is cost-effective for the job I needed it to do."", ""Fast shipping.Well packaged.All metal construction.Enough detail in instructions,easily installed,best of all:heater works great.No issues so far.I heat a decent size 2 car garage and this is all I need.Recomend a ceiling fan to force the heat down,same thing with all of 'em.I can not stand beneath this heater when it is on high,it is way beyond my expectations.It is not very big or impressive,but do not let that part fool ya,it is a good heater.I have left the thermostat inside the heater,so far this is working fine."", 'I have used 4 times now and I really like it. If you have a insulated two car garage this heater will do the job nicely.It only took about 30 minutes to go from 30° to  62° in an hour it was 71° had to turn it down to work though. I like it 57° to 63° when working on a project. This heater is perfect for my needs. Little less than $100 too!👍', ""I'm happy with this heater and wish I'd found it years ago. I installed it in my basement workshop and it is way better than the big baseboard heater and kerosene heater I'd been using for many years. It's quiet and easy to install and heats the basement better than I'd anticipated. The workmanship and quality are great and I especially like that the sheet metal parts are post painted as opposed to crummy pre-paint and so all the sheet metal cut edges and corners are painted and nice and smooth and burr free."", 'I use this heater turned down low just to knock the edge off the cold so I can work comfortably in my 3 car garage shop.  I have it set on about 1/3 of its capacity and it keeps the garage at about 55- 60, the way I like it.  If I were to turn it up on high it would make the garage toasty warm.  The installation was straight forward and simple.  I bought a plug, 15 ft. of 10-3 service cord and a cord grip to make the installation. I plug it into my 220 volt welder receptacle when I want to have heat.  Wish I had found it years ago.', 'Great heat output, replaced my floor oil heater and small plug in with this one.  Only reason I gave it a 4 not 5 is that # 1 the fan blade was loose when I got it and the simple mechanism makes a rattling noise that is not necessary.

Obviously this is meant to be used in a smaller, more insulated setting.  I wanted to try just one first, and then add as necessary.The heater itself seems to be well-built as far as structure, and designed well as far as installation and operation.  Including running wiring and building a wall mount (vaulted ceiling so no ceiling studs), it took 2-3hrs to get up and running.In my large uninsulated setting, over the course of 3-4hrs, it was able to raise the temperature from 25*F to 45*F, roughly speaking.  In other words, from intolerable to tolerable.  Which is about what I expected from it.  I think it would do quite well at maintaining a higher temperature if I were to use my propane 'salamander' to initially heat the space.Based on other's reviews and my own experience, there seems to be a major quality control concern in the assembly line for these regarding the fan nut.  I was unaware of this until after it was installed, but I'm almost certain I have the same issue as almost everyone else.  Before mounting the heater there was a nut and washer rattling around inside.  After a semi-thorough check, I figured it was an erroneous leftover.  Having read the reviews and after hearing a small rattle when the heater runs, I will be dismounting and tearing it down to install that nut properly.  This is both an inconvenience and really a potential danger.  For that I've removed a star from the rating.That being said, I will be purchasing another one, possibly two more.  Can't beat the price to performance ratio anywhere.Edit from the future:  I bought another one, slightly updated since the first.  This one had no problems and even runs quieter.  Awesome."", ""This heater does a great job heating my 24'x30' insulated shop. I have it on a Honeywell line thermostat, and typically keep it at 40* to keep water lines from freezing, but when I'm ready to work in the ship I just turn it up and in 20 minutes it's nice and toasty. The other day it was 30* outside, but on high this ran for less than 5 minutes every 20-30 minutes.The only potential negative to be aware of is that it has a slight whistle when it's running. It's enough that I think about it every time it starts up, but it's not enough to be a nuisance.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase; it was easy to install, and is cost-effective for the job I needed it to do."", ""Fast shipping.Well packaged.All metal construction.Enough detail in instructions,easily installed,best of all:heater works great.No issues so far.I heat a decent size 2 car garage and this is all I need.Recomend a ceiling fan to force the heat down,same thing with all of 'em.I can not stand beneath this heater when it is on high,it is way beyond my expectations.It is not very big or impressive,but do not let that part fool ya,it is a good heater.I have left the thermostat inside the heater,so far this is working fine."", 'I have used 4 times now and I really like it. If you have a insulated two car garage this heater will do the job nicely.It only took about 30 minutes to go from 30° to  62° in an hour it was 71° had to turn it down to work though. I like it 57° to 63° when working on a project. This heater is perfect for my needs. Little less than $100 too!👍', ""I'm happy with this heater and wish I'd found it years ago. I installed it in my basement workshop and it is way better than the big baseboard heater and kerosene heater I'd been using for many years. It's quiet and easy to install and heats the basement better than I'd anticipated. The workmanship and quality are great and I especially like that the sheet metal parts are post painted as opposed to crummy pre-paint and so all the sheet metal cut edges and corners are painted and nice and smooth and burr free."", 'I use this heater turned down low just to knock the edge off the cold so I can work comfortably in my 3 car garage shop.  I have it set on about 1/3 of its capacity and it keeps the garage at about 55- 60, the way I like it.  If I were to turn it up on high it would make the garage toasty warm.  The installation was straight forward and simple.  I bought a plug, 15 ft. of 10-3 service cord and a cord grip to make the installation. I plug it into my 220 volt welder receptacle when I want to have heat.  Wish I had found it years ago.', 'Great heat output, replaced my floor oil heater and small plug in with this one.  Only reason I gave it a 4 not 5 is that # 1 the fan blade was loose when I got it and the simple mechanism makes a rattling noise that is not necessary.  It only has a moving fan part but is kinda noisy.  Heats very well.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Comfort Zone Digital Fan-Forced Ceiling Mount Heater + Remote and LCD Display,169.80, ,"[""This replaced a 40 y/o unit that worked, but not well. Having the remote control makes temperature control much easier. The high mode provides instant heat when used and the guide vanes direct the flow well. I did replace the circuit breaker as this unit has a max draw of 31.4 amps (7500 watts)on high mode, and insured the wiring and connections were proper. It's below freezing outside and this unit cycles and maintains 63-68 degrees with a 72 degree setting. The area is an insulated 900 sqft and the temperature is read on the wall furthest from the unit. Until I get a better primary heat source this is a great unit to have till then."", ""The heater is built pretty tough, which is a good thing. I also found it easy to connect, which interestingly enough was more expensive for the materials than it was for the heater. Only problem is that it doesn't heat as well as advertised. It claimed to heat an area (uninsulated) that was 30x30. my garage is 25x35 so I figured that was basically the same thing. after running for an hour or more it only brought the temp up from 45* to about 52*. I guess that if I left it running all the time it would eventually gey there, but that was not what I was hoping for. Plus, those temps were only for the emediate area around the heater, the far end of the garage was still ice cold. In any account it is a good heater for the price. especially if you already have a place wired for it."", ""Havent used it yet, but looks nice. It's smaller than I thought but as long as it heats good then I'm ok with it. I was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the plug. Luckily I have an extra one. I will have it hooked up in a couple of days. Thanks. "", ""Installed in my 2 car garage, used the correct 8ga wire and double pole breaker. On high setting, it trips the breaker. Tried a different breaker, no luck. It doesn't heat the garage as well as I anticipated, but better than having no heater at all. I like the remote, it works well. Heater is quiet. Not impressed but whatever. I may end up moving it to my basement, where I believe it may work better. "", 'After researching different heater I found this to be the best deal, but the heat sensor is on the inside witch makes it shut off sooner than it should so I located it on the outside and it now works good. I also looked on youtube to see how to hook up 220w and found it to be really easy but make sure you use 8/3 wire and a 40amp double pull breaker for safety reasons. I have a 24x30 insulated garage with 8 foot ceilings and at 32 degrees it will heat up at about 10 degrees an hour and after a while when the heat is up a little bit it seems to heat up faster so I use my kerosene heater to speed things up a little and when it gets around 68 degrees this heater can maintain very easy. now just so you know I have 4 metal cars in my garage that retain cold air for quite a while so your garage might heat up faster depending what you have in it', ""I purchased this unit to replace my old one. The unit arrived very quickly. I think it took 4 days to get to me. Packaging was very stout, no damage to the unit. I did have a friend of mine help me install it but it wasn't really hard and could have done it in a pinch. Instructions were easy to read. I have a 25x25 sq ft shop, insulated to about R4 and this heater does a nice job of warming it with outside temps around around 32F. This unit is also nice in that I have a choice of hi or lo elements used to heat.I would recommend this and install it myself if I go to a larger building."", 'Great price, great size, easy to use', ""Not happy with this heater. First of all, the thermostat is not correct, as it is located INSIDE the heater where it stays hot. Must be set much much higher for desired temp. Second, and worst of all, when the heater switches ON or OFF, it makes a extremely loud BANG. Really disappointing for the price and would return it if it wasn't hard wired in. Regret buying the warranty, as I don't plan on keeping past it's first breakdown."", 'The temperature sensor is mounted in a way that the heater cuts off way before room temperature is reached.

Great unit, it keeps a 230 square foot room warm even in 10 degree F weather.', 'I bought this heater to replace the same one I installed in my lower level bathroom 20 years ago. The replacement was exactly the same size which made the replacement of the internal parts in the existing sheet metal frame very fast. It works well for this small bath to take the chill of the lower level out between heating seasons. After removing the existing Broan 174 I saw a build up of lint/dust on the back side of the heater eliment and it may not have been bad to begin with, so I will keep that in mind if it starts smelling hot (In the next 20 years). Bottom line is it work well to heat a small room quickly.', 'Very good to use in a small bathroom,I run it 240v for less power consumption ', 'it was exactly what I wanted --keeps my small bathroom very warm', 'Easy to install, heat is fast, fan is quiet, looks great.', 'This is the 5th of these heaters I have purchased.

Dr Infrared Heater Portable Space Heater 1500-Watt,165.49, ,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit. Doesn't even look like a heater, more like a piece of furniture or a speaker for a high end stereo system."", 'I hen purchase several brands of infrared heaters .   Dr. Heater is built solid .  Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.  Am not able to determine if I am saving money on this product or not running it continuously versus other types of heating methods.  Product works well - happy so far.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Decorative Electric Cabinet Space Heater w/Remote &Timer ~ 1500W ~ Portable   ,165.6,30-day returns,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit.

Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.

It was a 1500 watt model, but after installing the Com-Pak, that was only 1000 watts, it's output was higher. And it's construction was obviously of high higher quality.  And it is much quieter than old was, even when it was new. Only problem I had was it was slightly smaller to fit into the original hole in the wall.  Not the fault of the heater.

After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it.

Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them.

After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it.

Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them.

Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.

It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running.

Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.

Dr Infrared Heater Portable Space Heater 1500-Watt,165.49, ,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit.

Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose.

All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill.

My other heater once the garage reached the set temp it would automatically shut off until it needed to come back on again and so on all thru the nite thus saving me money on the electric bill because the temp stayed current !

"Comfort Zone 7,500 Watt 240V Digital Fan Ceiling Mount Heater w/ Remote CZ230ER",175.0,321 sold,"[""This replaced a 40 y/o unit that worked, but not well. Having the remote control makes temperature control much easier. The high mode provides instant heat when used and the guide vanes direct the flow well. I did replace the circuit breaker as this unit has a max draw of 31.4 amps (7500 watts)on high mode, and insured the wiring and connections were proper. It's below freezing outside and this unit cycles and maintains 63-68 degrees with a 72 degree setting. The area is an insulated 900 sqft and the temperature is read on the wall furthest from the unit. Until I get a better primary heat source this is a great unit to have till then."", ""The heater is built pretty tough, which is a good thing. I also found it easy to connect, which interestingly enough was more expensive for the materials than it was for the heater. Only problem is that it doesn't heat as well as advertised. It claimed to heat an area (uninsulated) that was 30x30. my garage is 25x35 so I figured that was basically the same thing. after running for an hour or more it only brought the temp up from 45* to about 52*. I guess that if I left it running all the time it would eventually gey there, but that was not what I was hoping for. Plus, those temps were only for the emediate area around the heater, the far end of the garage was still ice cold. In any account it is a good heater for the price. especially if you already have a place wired for it."", ""Havent used it yet, but looks nice. It's smaller than I thought but as long as it heats good then I'm ok with it. I was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the plug. Luckily I have an extra one. I will have it hooked up in a couple of days. Thanks. "", ""Installed in my 2 car garage, used the correct 8ga wire and double pole breaker. On high setting, it trips the breaker. Tried a different breaker, no luck. It doesn't heat the garage as well as I anticipated, but better than having no heater at all. I like the remote, it works well. Heater is quiet. Not impressed but whatever. I may end up moving it to my basement, where I believe it may work better. "", 'After researching different heater I found this to be the best deal, but the heat sensor is on the inside witch makes it shut off sooner than it should so I located it on the outside and it now works good. I also looked on youtube to see how to hook up 220w and found it to be really easy but make sure you use 8/3 wire and a 40amp double pull breaker for safety reasons. I have a 24x30 insulated garage with 8 foot ceilings and at 32 degrees it will heat up at about 10 degrees an hour and after a while when the heat is up a little bit it seems to heat up faster so I use my kerosene heater to speed things up a little and when it gets around 68 degrees this heater can maintain very easy. now just so you know I have 4 metal cars in my garage that retain cold air for quite a while so your garage might heat up faster depending what you have in it', ""I purchased this unit to replace my old one. The unit arrived very quickly. I think it took 4 days to get to me. Packaging was very stout, no damage to the unit. I did have a friend of mine help me install it but it wasn't really hard and could have done it in a pinch. Instructions were easy to read. I have a 25x25 sq ft shop, insulated to about R4 and this heater does a nice job of warming it with outside temps around around 32F. This unit is also nice in that I have a choice of hi or lo elements used to heat.I would recommend this and install it myself if I go to a larger building."", 'Great price, great size, easy to use', ""Not happy with this heater. First of all, the thermostat is not correct, as it is located INSIDE the heater where it stays hot. Must be set much much higher for desired temp. Second, and worst of all, when the heater switches ON or OFF, it makes a extremely loud BANG. Really disappointing for the price and would return it if it wasn't hard wired in. Regret buying the warranty, as I don't plan on keeping past it's first breakdown."", 'The temperature sensor is mounted in a way that the heater cuts off way before room temperature is reached.  Believe the sensor is getting reading from the case rather than ambient temperature.  ', 'Well Made. Easy to use. Shipping was fast, with damage. Easy to install. Easy to hang. Would highly recommend it if the square footage is right and it is insulated.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr Heater Buddy Portable Propane Indoor Outdoor Gas,174.95, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]",,"Unit Heater, Portable Oil Filled Radiator",Mr. Heater Buddy MH18B,0089301748002,,Mr. Heater,"Rotary Knob, Switch","Electric, Gas, Propane","Red, Gray, Yellow, Black",,"F274805, F274800, F274885, MH18B",,Radiant,,,Garage,,,,,,,18000,Not Electric,Indoor/Outdoor,Quiet,,250 to 499 sq ft,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was a 1500 watt model, but after installing the Com-Pak, that was only 1000 watts, it's output was higher. And it's construction was obviously of high higher quality.  And it is much quieter than old was, even when it was new. Only problem I had was it was slightly smaller to fit into the original hole in the wall.  Not the fault of the heater.

MRHEATER F232035 6000/12000 BTU Camo Hunting Buddy Propane Heater,172.2,60-day returns,"[""we finally got to use our mr. buddy heater while camping in our pop up tent this past weekend. waking up around 4 or 5 in the morning with the temperature about 45 degrees....that's a little chilly for us desert dwellers. mr. buddy takes the chill off in just a few minutes. the small, green portable propane tanks do get a bit frosty after about 45 minutes and if they are almost empty the unit just stops. I'm not sure if the unit stopping is due to the oxygen sensor or the bottled propane tank chilling because I used a partially filled bottle first, assumed it was empty, but found it still had liquid in it. after a few minutes I reinstalled it and started right up and ran until it was empty. we did have ample ventilation as the old pop up is not so tight and also we had the vent cracked a little. we experienced no headaches or notice of any lack of oxygen. all in all we really like it and recommend this to anyone. even on the low setting this unit does the trick. we found our large propane tank was empty when we got there so we did not get to use with the hose. the built in fan does work but we didn't use it this time. on a scale of 1 to 10 I give this item an automatic 20! I like it that much."", 'I have only 20 amps in my live work space.After running lights, television and other stuff, I did not have enough current left to run a space heater.

"Dr Infrared Heater Portable Space Heater, 1500-Watt",174.03, ,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit. Doesn't even look like a heater, more like a piece of furniture or a speaker for a high end stereo system."", 'I hen purchase several brands of infrared heaters .   Dr. Heater is built solid .  Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.

When the heater came, it was in almost newcosmetic and like new operational condition!  I was veryhappy!I have used it for 3 weeks so far in my 625 Sq. Ft. garagewith outside air temperatures as low as 24F.   At 24F, ittakes about an hour to heat the garage to 65F+; then itcycles on and off after that and maintains thetemperature just fine.

On a cold day I might need 3+ hours to get the room to working temp here in the Northeast..

After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use.

Mr Heater Buddy Portable Propane Indoor Outdoor Gas,174.95, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]",,"Unit Heater, Portable Oil Filled Radiator",Mr. Heater Buddy MH18B,0089301748002,,Mr. Heater,"Rotary Knob, Switch","Electric, Gas, Propane","Red, Gray, Yellow, Black",,"F274805, F274800, F274885, MH18B",,Radiant,,,Garage,,,,,,,18000,Not Electric,Indoor/Outdoor,Quiet,,250 to 499 sq ft,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was a 1500 watt model, but after installing the Com-Pak, that was only 1000 watts, it's output was higher. And it's construction was obviously of high higher quality.  And it is much quieter than old was, even when it was new. Only problem I had was it was slightly smaller to fit into the original hole in the wall.  Not the fault of the heater.

MRHEATER F232035 6000/12000 BTU Camo Hunting Buddy Propane Heater,172.2,60-day returns,"[""we finally got to use our mr. buddy heater while camping in our pop up tent this past weekend. waking up around 4 or 5 in the morning with the temperature about 45 degrees....that's a little chilly for us desert dwellers. mr. buddy takes the chill off in just a few minutes. the small, green portable propane tanks do get a bit frosty after about 45 minutes and if they are almost empty the unit just stops. I'm not sure if the unit stopping is due to the oxygen sensor or the bottled propane tank chilling because I used a partially filled bottle first, assumed it was empty, but found it still had liquid in it. after a few minutes I reinstalled it and started right up and ran until it was empty. we did have ample ventilation as the old pop up is not so tight and also we had the vent cracked a little. we experienced no headaches or notice of any lack of oxygen. all in all we really like it and recommend this to anyone. even on the low setting this unit does the trick. we found our large propane tank was empty when we got there so we did not get to use with the hose. the built in fan does work but we didn't use it this time. on a scale of 1 to 10 I give this item an automatic 20! I like it that much."", 'I have only 20 amps in my live work space.After running lights, television and other stuff, I did not have enough current left to run a space heater.

After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up.

The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use.

"Hiland-HLDS01-CGT-Tall Patio Heater, Hammered Bronze Finish",172.54, ,"['The heater was quick to put together. Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.  "", 'It came on time.  Easy to put together but the pilot won’t light. Very disappointing! I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.  If I can’t get it to light, I’m returning it.', ""I purchased it couple of years ago, but after couple of time using it, the heater wouldn't turn on!!! I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door. It didn’t come with the bolts for that but no problem a couple small nuts and bolts from my garage and it is awesome!', 'The Items are both working fine so far.

"Dr Infrared Heater Portable Space Heater, 1500-Watt",174.03, ,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit.

Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.  Am not able to determine if I am saving money on this product or not running it continuously versus other types of heating methods.

Garage Heater Electric 5600 Watt 120-Volt Built-in Adjustable Thermostat Black,174.4, ,"['This heater was offered as ""Manufacturer refurbished"".I was willing to accept cosmetic damage to save somemoney.  When the heater came, it was in almost newcosmetic and like new operational condition!  I was veryhappy!I have used it for 3 weeks so far in my 625 Sq. Ft. garagewith outside air temperatures as low as 24F.   At 24F, ittakes about an hour to heat the garage to 65F+; then itcycles on and off after that and maintains thetemperature just fine.  I haven\'t had to turn the thermostatup more than 2/3 of the way to be able to work in asummer shirt and jeans.BTW my garage is insulated and sheet-rocked on all thewalls and the ceiling.  (The ceiling is 9 1/2\' high.)  Thegarage doors are also insulated with foam sheets in thepanels.I put the heater on the floor (as required by the safetyinstructions) facing into the garage.  It sits on and blowsacross a carpet which never gets warm as the heat goesup.  The heater fan keeps the air mixed well and keepsthe temperature even throughout the garage. ', ""I think this is a decent heater. Easy install, quiet, simple, but it does take a while to get room heat up. On a cold day I might need 3+ hours to get the room to working temp here in the Northeast.. But, I would suggest counting on it for less than the rated SqFt in your shop application.I may need a second one, and now I am faced with the fact that I should have gone with higher BTU's on a single unit to begin with."", 'Very happy with this heater, especially for the price! I have a 1225 sq ft garage with tall ceilings and this keeps it a nice 60 degrees at all times. I was not expecting it to keep the garage so nice and warm. Very happy with it, the blower is a little noisy at times but that doesn’t bother me, especially at this price. ', 'I Purchased this for a restaurant and was not quite sure it would work. Well it turned out it was better then I had hoped for. I have it up high so it blows across the ceiling, fans pick up the heat and send it gently down. Wow Just Wow. It works fantastic..', ""Haven't had it very long, but I believe it is going to work great for what I intended to use it for and that is too heat my work shop."", 'Not sure as of yet for I have not used it.

Hiland-HLDS01-CGT-Tall Patio Heater Hammered Bronze Finish,172.69,30-day returns,"['The heater was quick to put together. Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.

I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.  If I can’t get it to light, I’m returning it.', ""I purchased it couple of years ago, but after couple of time using it, the heater wouldn't turn on!!! I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!!

Mr Heater Buddy Portable Propane Indoor Outdoor Gas,174.95, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]",,"Unit Heater, Portable Oil Filled Radiator",Mr. Heater Buddy MH18B,0089301748002,,Mr. Heater,"Rotary Knob, Switch","Electric, Gas, Propane","Red, Gray, Yellow, Black",,"F274805, F274800, F274885, MH18B",,Radiant,,,Garage,,,,,,,18000,Not Electric,Indoor/Outdoor,Quiet,,250 to 499 sq ft,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was a 1500 watt model, but after installing the Com-Pak, that was only 1000 watts, it's output was higher. And it's construction was obviously of high higher quality.  And it is much quieter than old was, even when it was new. Only problem I had was it was slightly smaller to fit into the original hole in the wall.  Not the fault of the heater.

MRHEATER F232035 6000/12000 BTU Camo Hunting Buddy Propane Heater,172.2,60-day returns,"[""we finally got to use our mr. buddy heater while camping in our pop up tent this past weekend. waking up around 4 or 5 in the morning with the temperature about 45 degrees....that's a little chilly for us desert dwellers. mr. buddy takes the chill off in just a few minutes. the small, green portable propane tanks do get a bit frosty after about 45 minutes and if they are almost empty the unit just stops. I'm not sure if the unit stopping is due to the oxygen sensor or the bottled propane tank chilling because I used a partially filled bottle first, assumed it was empty, but found it still had liquid in it. after a few minutes I reinstalled it and started right up and ran until it was empty. we did have ample ventilation as the old pop up is not so tight and also we had the vent cracked a little. we experienced no headaches or notice of any lack of oxygen. all in all we really like it and recommend this to anyone. even on the low setting this unit does the trick. we found our large propane tank was empty when we got there so we did not get to use with the hose. the built in fan does work but we didn't use it this time. on a scale of 1 to 10 I give this item an automatic 20!

After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off.

After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.

I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door.

"Dr Infrared Heater Portable Space Heater, 1500-Watt",174.03, ,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit.

Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won’t last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.

The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.  "", 'It came on time.  Easy to put together but the pilot won’t light. Very disappointing! I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.  If I can’t get it to light, I’m returning it.', ""I purchased it couple of years ago, but after couple of time using it, the heater wouldn't turn on!!! I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door. It didn’t come with the bolts for that but no problem a couple small nuts and bolts from my garage and it is awesome!', 'The Items are both working fine so far. My only issue is, one of the items was considerably damaged as you can see in the pictures.', 'Incredible bargain, and very well made. Hot! Hot! Hot1 The assembly is a bit challenging, but worth the effort.', 'As described, very well made, nice looking!', 'Great price.  Works as advertised.  would recommend']","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.
