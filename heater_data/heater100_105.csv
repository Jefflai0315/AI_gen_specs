Broan 157 Aluminum NuTone Low-Profile Fan-Forced Ceiling Heater 120Vac,, ,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.

Quality product. Did have to temper out the smell it emits on first use. Just ran it on high outside in shed for about 8 hours until the odor was no more. No problem!!', ""Damn near perfect. I love the timer and the option to set temperature down to the exact degree.  It's so quiet you don't notice it's running until you either get up real close, or you feel the warm air blowing. Only thing I would add is the ability to have it turn on at a certain time in addition to the current option of turning off."", 'Product is good - it is hard to figure out how to shut of the item though since it is all digital now.', ""I had an older version of the AVH2. Had it for many years til it finally gave out and I purchased this newer unit. I have it in my bedroom on low heat set at 66 degrees. It puts out some decent heat even on that low of a setting. Not good for a very large room but, smaller rooms you just can't go wrong. Excellent product..... !!!!!!"", 'Best of the Vornado whole room heaters for functionality - some of the others come on as fan each time you turn them on and you have to then set heat temp whereas this one remembers how it was last set.We have 3 of them in our house to bump up the heat just where we need it.  My grown-up kids all have them too after seeing how great they are.Definitely saves on heating costs and we use less propane because of it.', 'I am using the Vornado AVH2 to heat part of a large finished basement space.

Mr Heater F232050 4K - 9K BTU Portable Buddy Heater,104.64,30-day returns,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Lasko 5572 Room Heater - Ceramic - Electric - Charcoal, Silver",,30-day returns,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters.

The ability of the unit to oscillate and the fact that it has remote control makes this about as convenient as it gets. Lots of good features and controls. Only caution is to make sure that you don't have two of these units plug into outlets that are on the same breaker.  If you do the breaker has to be at least 20amps. Anything less will trip the breaker on high draw when the heaters are warming the room.

I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time.

Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off.

In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.

Lasko Products 5572 Ceramic Tower Heater,104.99,30-day returns,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater. And If I have to replace any one of the heaters I have, it will be with a Lasko 5572 heater.HJ of Missouri', ""We were absolutely thrilled with the size and capability of this room heater.  It's a little taller than the other Lasko portable heater and our decision to get it was a good one. For our needs, this one is perfect. "", 'I really enjoy my heater.  I live in Arizona where it is getting cooler at night now.  It is very efficient and quiet.', 'Heats small area immediately in the morning, with an increase of 5-10 degrees in temperature within 15 minutes.  Easy to operate, with remote.

Don't have to wait for anything to warm up  immediate heat..  2 modes low 900w and high 1500w..

One is #5165, the other one is #755320, the only complaint I have on this model is I had to stick a piece of foam tale on the top of the carrying slot in back so my finger wouldn't slip out of the carrying slot when carrying the heater.  The other heater's slot is angled so your fingers don't slip out.  The one remote does control either heater.  I recommended my satisfaction to a friend and he bought one and is happy with it.

"Mr. Heater 9000 BTU Portable Heating, Rugged Lightweight Compact Propane Heater",102.64,Last item available,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Lasko 755320 Ceramic Space Tower Heater 8.5″L x 7.25″W x 23″H Silver,101.28,30-day returns,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit. The Oscillation can be Set by The Remote as well. PROS: Great Designed Unit.

 Space Heater Electric Portable Fan w/ Thermostat Home Office Workspace 1500-W,100.36,30-day returns,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time. I put the heater in max mode and not matter what it just wasn't throwing out enough heat.You literally have to be right in front of the heater to feel anything. I wanted something affordable that was not powered by propane however they do say u get what you paid for."", ""I bought two of these for my garage and disregarded the previous reviews i read. The fan barely puts air out. It gets hot, but the fan almost seems like the motor is junk. I'll still use it. I'll just put a box fan behind it so it can actually move heat around."", ""The heater is built well and is safe however its useless in a garage or outdoors. I would recommend it for use in a indoor room or basement environment where it doesn't have to compete with more harsh temperatures. Not exactly what I was hoping for!"", 'This looks good in the pictures, but is a terrible heater. The forced air is a joke. Plus it does not get hot. With the thermostat on high, after 15 minutes, I could still hold my hand about six inches in front of the grill. Very disappointed.', 'I thought I was going to buy this to upgrade the heater I use at work in the shop. I ended up just putting it in my car that I’m working on on the side of my house. It gets to about 80° inside just a car. I don’t expect it would be able to heat the shop. The fan is very weak as well.', 'It is good product for the price, it is slow on heating a large area but keeps it at a good temperature.', 'It came in a timely manner and works great as long as its pointed at you.

"Lasko 755320 Ceramic Space Tower Heater, 8.5″L X 7.25″W X 23″H, Silver",104.53, ,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit. The Oscillation can be Set by The Remote as well. PROS: Great Designed Unit.

"Mr. Heater Buddy 4,000-9,000-BTU Indoor-Safe Portable Propane Radiant Heater",100.0, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","Used: An item that has been used previously.

Mr. Heater Portable Big Buddy Propane Heater,100.0, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr.heater Portable Buddy Heater 4000 To 9000 Btu F232000,102.07,35 sold,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Super quiet! I am using it in what was a screened-in lanai (remodeled into a 4-season sunroom). With all these windows it gets chilly in here at times, even though the room has central heat.

Mr. Heater Portable Buddy Heater ,101.52, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Portable Oil-Filled Radiator DeLonghi Electric Space Heater 1500W ComforTemp New,100.0, ,"['The product is keeping me and my critters from being cold.. really can not ask for much more.. Living conditions that it is trying to heat will effect the overall quality of the heat held with the area... but I do recommend this heater... got my sister to buy one as well.', ""I had owned a DeLonghi oil filled heater for many years and was pleased with it's long service. This unit is newer design and i didn't realize that is was smaller than my other one. It works great and looks great but is not able to put out the amount of heat necessary for a larger room. I would recommend it for small to medium rooms. It looks good but at the same wattage doesn't seem to put out the same amount of heat. If you need one I would pay the extra $15 and get the larger model. It would be worth it. It is the best when operated on high with the ComFort switch on. That brings the heater to a certain preset temp and then shuts it down. It then cycles on and off as needed. However that is 1500 watts so watch your electric bill! I would buy again but the larger one so it could operate at a lower wattage."", 'So far, I have only used it mostly in LOW and a couple of nights in MEDIUM (with TEMP setting at about 65%) in my computer room (room door closed). Same with my previous (another brand) in the bedroom, and plan a third in the kitchen. I expect to beat the gas company this winter with some $250 off my regular winter gas bill... ;-)  Oh, and my electric bill? Some $4 to 5 Dllrs more last two months... Yes, buy them!', ""These oil filled heaters are very good at delivering a even heat in spaces they are designed to cover.I own 2 and use them in a 30' travel trailer throughout the year as needed. I live in west Oregon and find these are all I need most days during the Fall and Winter.I recommend them to anyone needing a soft, even, heating system."", 'Prior to buying our DeLonghi EW7707CM Radiator Heater we were having to run our central heating unit at a higher setting in order to keep our bedroom comfortable at night.  We saw this as a waste of fuel, and with fuel prices like they are now, we decided to use the DeLonghi heater in our bedroom as an auxillary heat source.  We are now able to set our central unit\'s thermostat on 58 instead of 65 and maintain a comfortable temperature in the bedroom with the DeLonghi Radiator Heater.  We have seen VERY little increase in electricity consumption since we began using it and quite a bit of savings on fuel oil!!  It has been well worth the money we paid for it!!!The DeLonghi Radiator Heater is easy to use, has variable temperature settings and a energy saving mode. The only noise it makes is a faint ""click"" when it cycles on or off. We are thoroughly pleased with our purchase of it and we certainly recommend it to others!!', ""LOVE DeLonghi heaters.  I have used them for years as a secondary heat source.  They out last the competition.  The 24 hour timer and thermostat ensures that you can keep your house cozy and warm even in frigid northern Idaho winter temperatures.  My wood guy recommended these heaters telling me that they were the most cost effective electric heaters money could buy.  I've never been disappointed and this newest model is well worth the price."", 'This is a great product!  Works and looks like new. Heats your room after a little time and stays warm. Low energy efficient!', 'For those of you who love tropical fruit tree, you will know most tropical fruit tree could not survive temperature below 40 degree F, putting typical heater in the green house will mean unnecessary waste of energy since lowest temperature of most heater start at 60 degree F. This heater is perfect for such situation:1. If set at ""*"" position, It only turn on if temperature drop below 41 degree F. This mean minimal need of these heater to maintain temperature above 41 degree F.2. It is oil based, that mean no risk of fire.3. It is water proof, so it is safe to use outdoor.This is the only heater that do all the three thing we need to winterize tropical fruit tree in the green house.To me this is a priceless heater. Hope you will benefit from this great heater as well.', 'Carton was delivered with scoffed marks and several visible holes.The radiator had several dents near top.However, it worked fine and all controls were intact.The price was right and I considered it a “second”I’m satisfied.', 'This is a great room heater, my room is 18ftx18ft and I always use this heater at low setting and it really heats up the room.The heater is stable so I don’t need to worry it will fall and the surface does not get too hot. It heats the room evenly.I read some reviews online that it gives out some smell initially, I also had that experience but if you let it run for around 10 hours for the first time it will go away.I would recommend this heater for a mid to large sized room that has proper insulation.I have to use it the entire season before I can comment on the electricity usage but hopefully it will bring down my bill.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Lasko Designer Series Ceramic Space Heater-New,101.75, ,"[""This is the 3rd purchase of the same heater.  1st for one of my sons, 2nd for my boss and 3rd to replace a noisy old heater at my desk.  Not only does it produce heat well but it is also is aesthetically pleasing in an office setting.  Those points combined with many levels of heat to chose from and a remote control feature to boot...perfection!!  Three purchases and each for less than $60...it's a winner!!"", ""The reason I wanted this heater was I needed supplemental heat to my daughters room which is the furthest from the central heating system and surrounded by three ouside walls. Have been using a small oscillating ceramic heater for a couple years, but not thermostat controlled. Love the Lasko, cause it heats room evenly and quickly! Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature. If you can run it on High which draws 12-14 Amps then it will work well for you! Why they disable temperature controlled operation in Low mode is baffling to me! ', 'This heater is a pretty good source of additional warmth where you need it. You may get tired of people asking you what it is though... It will not heat an entire home, but in my 22x28 living room, it does a pretty good job warming things up. Quiet and pretty. The remote works great, (even though it is almost as weird of a shape as the heater).', ""The heater is very dependable , I've had one for 1 year now. I have purchased two additional for other rooms. These units do the job of heating rooms well. They're very fashionable convenient."", 'first off gotta say this heater warms a medium size room very fast..and very wellalso easy to operate. only problem is the heater is very noise. looked over the reviewspeople said very quit very little sound NOT true loud fan and when oscillating is onmakes a verroom verroom sound [ best way to describe it]  gonna need to get out theear plugs gave it four stars for its heating', ""This little heater is great for taking the chill out of the air. My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me. (Don't rely on this heater being your main source of heat but rather as a supplement)."", ""expertbenefitsI haven't had it too long but it fits my purpose. I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable. It kind of cute too!"", 'I like the design of the heater very much and it certainly has enough output to heat what I intended it for.  I also like the features that it offers.  The only thing that I wish it did and it does not do is turn back on when the thermostat goes below what it is set at as well as turn off when it reaches the temperature.  All in all though, it is a good value and I have been pleased with it.', ""Granted it's not more than 1000 square feet, but this pretty little heater sits in the center of my house and keeps the whole house comfortable.  It has a thermostat,  (only 5 degree increments) but still will save me money by shutting off when the room is warm enough.  It has a convenient remote control.  First time I used it I smelled some electrical burning sent.  It only lasted a little while.  Seems fine now.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Lasko 755320 Ceramic Space Tower Heater, 8.5″L x 7.25″W x 23″H, Silver",100.78,30-day returns,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit. The Oscillation can be Set by The Remote as well. PROS: Great Designed Unit.

Keeps my whole RV toasty warm. I would recommend by a large propane tank to refill the 1 pound tanks. Much cheaper. But I’ve not been cold once. The safety feature of turning off it it tilts is great. Only problem I have found is the bottom piece you place on propane tank does not secure properly and falls off when lifted off the ground to move the heater. ', 'This little buddy heater is a fine unit for use in an ice fishing shelter or flip over sled / tent. It is the right size and has a small footprint.The angle of the head heating element is perfect for warming wet hands and can be easily aimed to direct the heater output.The only down side is that it can be difficult to light in even the slightest breeze.', ""This is just the right amount of heat and size  for my needs compared to the regular Mr. Heater but does not hold up to heavy use. Have had a regular size that I use in an icefishing house that has years of use on it. The little buddies I've had are lucky to make an ice season before getting had to light and the just quitting. Love the little buddies while they work but the regular Mr buddy is a much better long term value."", 'I bought this to heat my ice fishing hut and only used it a handful of times. Looks like it’s made pretty durable, the igniter works good, like the carry handle, the metal shield cools down pretty quick if you want to move spots. The negatives are the sensor for the automatic shut off is way too sensitive, if you dont have it pretty close to PERFECTLY flat it goes out which is a pain. Also there is no heat control so once it’s first lit it’s just barely staying lit, can’t have any wind blow on it or it goes out, plus once the honeycomb section is lit well finally and red it’s burning propane at such a low rate heat does not blow out of it, it only rises from it. I guess the plus to that is low propane consumption but it would be nice to be able to crank it up if you want to blow some heat at you. This is a new school version of a metal coffee can with a roll of toilet paper inside soaked in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol. ', ""These things do a good job of heating my small fish house, but it does not take long and they get hard to light and won't work Have gone through three in three ice fishing seasons.. The regular size Mr. Heater is more reliable and I should probably just stick with those but the smaller size and a bit less btu's just works better in my tiny and very well insulated fish house.Have tried the cleaning method described in the manual but it is very hard to take apart and nothing seems to help."", 'Bought 3 fir use to heat bedrooms in the house during power outages.  Just arrived and a week later a planned one day power outage.  With new born baby, needed to ensure both mom and baby would stay warm.  Used the heater and it was fine.  ', ""I have the larger Mr. Heater for our sailboat works great! So I bought this for our RTT roof top tent ..works good don't get as hot which is good for a tent ,But! the base that holds the 1lb tank should be twice the size feels like it could fall over .I plan on fabricating a larger base :)                                                                        -=CC=-"", ""Not cheap. It is tippy with the 1 lb cylinder. I asked Mr Heater for a parts list to hard pipe it directly to a 5 lb or 20 lb cylinder and I got parts list for using a hose. I don't want to use a hose. I like that it is quiet. I like that you don't need matches. I wish it had more than 1 heat output setting. It seems to be the best match available of heat output needed for my collapsible fish house."", ""I used this in my motorhome to keep the chill off at night and not have to use the furnace, which runs the batteries down significantly while boon-docking. It will run for 6 hours on one propane bottle, so it will not last all night. However, if you start it at midnight, it will run until 6 AM, at which time you can turn on your furnace for a short time if you're an early riser. Alternatively, if you don't want to run the furnace in order to save batteries, you could light the burners on your stove. Be sure to crack a window so as not to deplete all the oxygen. This unit works well."", ""Light weight. Compact.It doesn't take up allot of space. Easy to use. Does a good job heating my Ice Fishing Hub perfectly.

"Mr. Heater F242010 MH4GC Golf Cart Heater,Silver and Black",101.14,30-day returns,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

1500-Watt Portable Electric Space Heater with Pivoting Base,101.16,30-day returns,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time. I put the heater in max mode and not matter what it just wasn't throwing out enough heat.You literally have to be right in front of the heater to feel anything. I wanted something affordable that was not powered by propane however they do say u get what you paid for."", ""I bought two of these for my garage and disregarded the previous reviews i read. The fan barely puts air out. It gets hot, but the fan almost seems like the motor is junk. I'll still use it. I'll just put a box fan behind it so it can actually move heat around."", ""The heater is built well and is safe however its useless in a garage or outdoors. I would recommend it for use in a indoor room or basement environment where it doesn't have to compete with more harsh temperatures. Not exactly what I was hoping for!"", 'This looks good in the pictures, but is a terrible heater. The forced air is a joke. Plus it does not get hot. With the thermostat on high, after 15 minutes, I could still hold my hand about six inches in front of the grill. Very disappointed.', 'I thought I was going to buy this to upgrade the heater I use at work in the shop. I ended up just putting it in my car that I’m working on on the side of my house. It gets to about 80° inside just a car. I don’t expect it would be able to heat the shop.

"Mr. Heater F232000 MH9BX Buddy 4,000-9,000-BTU Indoor-Safe Portable Propane...",100.67, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply.
