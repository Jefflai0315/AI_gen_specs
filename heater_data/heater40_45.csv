My only complaint is that the heater, hi/lo fan selector switch is very tight to turn, but I've learned to live with it.

New Lasko CD08200 Bathroom Heater White Ceramic,44.99, ,"[""I put this bathroom heater in my bedroom to compare with another good Lasko room heater of similar size and the same 1500 W but with different features. I like the angle of the heat blast from this bathroom heater better for when I'm sitting on my bed getting dressed in front of the heater, I am happier with the other in my office. which has a steeper angle of blast and a thermostat.I also use this bathroom heater in the bathroom for which it was intended. I wanted it above the sink level for safety, as there's nowhere else to put the heater but on the sink counter.  I  turned a fire safe small ceramic square kleenex holder upside down, and the heater's feet fit nicelyinside.This bathroom heater is convenient because of the one press button for a preset one hour of high heat for quick warmups such as in the bathroom or when getting dressed. No fussing with buttons. It also has High and Low settings that run without a timer.I also noticed that some sellers were saying their heaters were OK for the bathroom but the actual manufacturer did not.  This Bathroom heater is designed for the bathroom.  I'm not sure if the tripper in the cord is necessary if the outlet has one too, as many houses do these days in any water environment such as the bathroom or the kitchen.  I'm guessing the tripper in the plug reacts to the unit rather than the wall socket."", ""This heater does an excellent job of putting out a lot of air with the fan and also Heats the room excellently. For my application I'm using it in a fifth wheel trailer bathroom which is fairly small but one of the problems I'm having with the heater is I'm using a different thermostat on it that is more accurate to turn on and off and the heater shuts off and doesn't come back on when I use the thermostat on it so what you need to do is put something on the round button on top of the heater and tape it down to hold the button down all the time so that thermostat that I've got set up works properly and we'll kick the heater on when the temperature drops or more so when I want to heat the bathroom during a certain time of the day like when I take a shower.Otherwise the heater is an excellent heater and I would highly recommend anybody to buy it very good quality."", 'The heater is modern in design. It has a one hour feature that I love. I turn it on , shower get dressed in a warm bathroom, never have to wonder if I left it running. It automatically shuts off after 1 hour.', ""1. easy to turn on and off2. heats up fast3. has 1-hour auto shutoff4. very sturdy design, not likely to tip over5. made for humid areas like bathroomsbonus: it's cute!"", ""Here's the story:  To have my small bathroom warm when I get up in the morning for my shower, I had a small ceramic 1500 Watt heater connected into a wall timer to turn on automatically, and if I forgot (which I often did) to turn off automatically. With this Lasko heater, I tap the top when I'm ready to shower and it turns on high for one hour. Firstly, I don't have to remember to turn it off. Secondly, the velocity of the hot air coming out is so high that the bathroom heats up much quicker than my other heater, even though the wattage of both units is the same. This saves my electric bill.It seems to be good, quality wise, but it's only a month old now so we'll see.  November, 2020A note:  After it's turned off, and the top button (the big and only one) is tapped, it starts at the timed one hour 1500 Watt setting automatically."", ""It is difficult to find a space heater that is specifically for bathroom use. I was happy to find this one at this price and good reviews! It does exactly what I need it to do, I warm up my bathroom before a shower as my heat does not do that well - North side of house in Wisconsin! I will see how it holds up this winter, but so far very pleased with it's performance."", 'Works great! Instant heat . Small size is great. Comes with wet location plug  &amp; cord', ""Perfect replacement for my old heater that finally died. Small, lightweight, gets super warm in my little bathroom. Like that it's specifically made to use in a bathroom. Warming, the front grill can get hot!"", 'This little heater has all the power i need to heat up the bathroom in a hurry.

Lasko Heater Electric Portable Personal Space Nonslip Base 200-Watt Purple,44.56,30-day returns,"[""At 200 watts, it's only intend for a small area, under a work desk, for instance. It doesn't have a thermostat, so it runs all the time it's on, but, it does have over heat protection. It's suppose to have a switch to kick it off if it's knocked over, but, either it doesn't, or mine doesn't work. However, the case doesn't get hot, so I'm not really to concerned  I used mine to blow heat under my bed when it's cold, it's small enough that it sets below my box springs, so it's not blowing on the bed but under it. It serves my purpose perfectly. I'm probably going to buy a couple more, 1 for under my desk at home, 1 so I will have a spare."", 'This is a solid little space heater but the amount of heat that comes out seems proportional to it\'s energy use.  I use it for my feet but if it\'s really cold in the space that it\'s being used in, it wouldn\'t be enough heat to be effective even for something like feet.The only reason I bought this one is because my previous order for the same heater was cancelled by \tXA-ELECTRONICS.  First they sent me an email that they were refunding my money with no explanation then later an email arrived saying the reason for the cancelled transaction was that ""The seller says that both of you disagreed over the terms of the transaction"".  This is completely untrue because I had nothing to say about it, so it was just a complete waste of time for me and I still have no idea why they cancelled it without any explanation.  i tried to contact them about this but haven\'t received a response.I would definitely support JONI-MARKET for their extremely fast shipping and excellent service but unless you want a lot of games with extremely poor communication I would avoid like the plague XA-ELECTRONICS for any purchases.', ""When I received this... I won't lie, I thought that this was too small to really make a difference. Until I used it. It's as simple as turning it on or not. It only has one direction. I bought another bigger fancier heater.... Honestly I felt like I was getting cooked. Too hot and made the room feel like a sauna. This one can make a smaller bedroom warm but not uncomfortably so. I liked this heater so much I bought it 3x, not for me but for 3 more people. Its compact and VERY user friendly."", 'Really great small heater that can handle being moved around. Would purchase this item again if I needed a second one. Probably will for backups.', 'I love my little heater and it keeps me warm all night. It actually heats my room and keeps it toasty. I am thinking of ordering another one for my daughter.', 'I\'ve used many space heaters both ceramic and conventional and I\'d swear this little dude puts out more heat than larger units when running on their 500 watt settings! A thermostat would be nice but for this price point, I can\'t complain. Even though this is made in China (and what isn\'t nowadays?!?) it seems better than average ""import"" quality. I\'d buy one again and/or recommend one!  :^)', 'In order to use so little power the fan barely forces the heat forward. Best if you put it under or right in front of desired area.

My only complaint is that the heater, hi/lo fan selector switch is very tight to turn, but I've learned to live with it.

Make sure and close the doors of the room. But the other room is venting warmer air into the cooler room you say.

"Vornado MVH Vortex Heater, Heats Whole Room, Black",44.69, ,"['I live in Nebraska and put the Vornado in a 25’x12’ ventless corner basement room with 4 windows. It works adequately for that room. It takes 10-15 minutes on the high setting to heat entire room so I can’t imagine ever using the low setting there. Maybe in a smaller room or camper or a warmer climate it would be needed. The Vornado is so quiet and the heating element hardly glows, that when first turned on I wasn’t sure it was working. It has a safety switch on the bottom and needs to be placed on a hard flat surface. It’s very compact and the plastic exterior makes it lightweight. That exterior though doesn’t seem real sturdy so I’ve got it up off the floor to avoid getting kicked or trod on. For the price and purpose I’m satisfied.', ""After searching for a year for a replacement for our beloved Braun heater we have finally found one that works well. The Vornado is not the design leader that the old Braun was but it does come close on one of the most important features for us. We use this heater in a quiet office environment, therefore the heater has to be quiet. We tried a popular Fasco, a Caframo that is styled after the Braun, and other brands. All were too noisy. The Vornado is not whisper silent like the Braun, but it come close. The noise level is about like a modern computer.Other features we like on the Vornado are the 3 heat settings, a fairly accurate thermostat and a decent length cord. The design is upright where the Braun was low. The vertical design with the large blade fan helps the Vornado more more air which helps warm up the room more quickly. It has a discrete small red led light that lets you know it's on. The heater is made in China.The downsides of this heater are minor. The heat range selector switch is not intuitive and dimly marked. You need to shine a light on it and maybe consult the manual to remember what the cryptic I, II, III markings mean. (I=low, II=med, III=high). And the case is shiny plastic which is a static electricity magnet. It attracts dust and animal hair easily. These are small issues. We normally leave the unit on one heat setting and it is under the desk, so pretty much out of sight. The black case helps it hide. Overall the heater looks to be well made and it's doing its job well. The price is a little high for a simple heater, but we are happy with it."", ""This is the third one of these I have bought. While it has a maximum of 1500 watts, these heat a room the most evenly of anything you can buy. It is quiet and you won't get burned like other heaters. "", ""This is my second Vornado fan I've purchased. My first one is still working perfectly but I never want to be without one and may use this second one when I travel.  I live in a rental suite that is chilly in Spring and Fall. Despite how benign this fan looks it produces a significant amount of heat.  I only start the day running this heater on the 1000 Watt (medium) setting and then turn down to low for the remainder of the day. It heats my open floor plan living room and dining room exceptionally well without driving up the electrical bill. Cheaper than running the furnace or my natural gas fireplace (altho come winter we use that in conjunction with the heater fan).  Bear in mind this is the most reliable model. Other models of heater fans by Vornado do not have the longevity of this one yet still cost as much or more. Read the reviews and choose this model for great value."", ""This little room heater is outstanding. I bought it for my daughter's bedroom is she's on the second floor and as we heat with wood sometimes your room cools down below normal during the winter. This little heater keeps her room nice and toasty I would recommend it"", 'Heats the bedroom up quickly.

Presto Heat Dish Parabolic Electric Heater Model 0792201,40.0,30-day returns,"[""I use this heater in my clinic and my patients absolutely love it. It's amazing how quickly it heats a room without air blasting or noise. It has a nice safety feature where it makes a horrible noise if it's tipping over (it only happens if I'm moving it when it's on). In fact several of my patients have gone out and bought their own for home. I should get a commission."", 'I have an old 1911 craftsman style house with no insulation.  My heating system is an outdated oil furnace.  As we all know the price of fuel is always fluctuating and seems like it is going to stay that way.  It costs me about $300.00 a month in the winter.  Which is ridiculous, especially when the heat just does not stay in the house for long.I needed a knew plan and changing out the heat system or insulating the house is not an option at this time.  So I went out and bought the presto heatdish.  It produces so much heat that during the winter I no longer had to heat the entire house to stay warm.  I would just carry the heatdish around with me, saving me hundreds of dollars month to month.  I had a few other electric heaters before I purchased this one and the difference is night and day.I  have had this heater for almost 3 years now and it still works as well as the day I purchased it.  It paid for itself in its first week work.  With as much use as this gets I would of expected it to burn out a while ago, but that is not the case.The drawbacks: It does not have an automatic turn off system if it were to fall over, but it does have an alarm that is unmistakably loud.   There is also a footlight that you cannot turn off or on, but you can just take out the lightbulb if that bothers you.Great product and highly recommended. Thanks for reading.', ""Proven, ancient technology that outperforms the daylights of newer, highly rated products. It's effective (heats the room quickly and thoroughly), efficient (only 1,000 watts), safe (automatic shut-off features), and built to last. Sometimes a product cannot be improved upon.  "", 'It gives off a good amount of heat but it has one big design flaw where the dish can not be tilted. This means the dish is in a fixed position which points into the air slightly. So if the surface you place it on is taller than you are while seated you will struggle to feel it. The safety tip over buzzer also prevents you from sliding something underneath it to tilt it yourself.', ""This is a wonderful heater.  I am a smoker and visit my family a lot.  I choose to smoke in the garage there and my sister in law bought this for me to use in the garage. It warms up quickly for the immediate area and it doesn't take long for the surrounding areas to warm up either. Once this gets going I don't even need a coat.  (Ohio area)  I have a house with very tall ceilings in the master bedroom and living area.  In the winter this little heater warms up quickly, even going right to the high setting.  I always have to turn it way back too.  I am widowed now and I don't need to keep the entire house warm, just where I am.  I do recommend this.  Oh, it is safe, if you move it at all when it is on you get a loud buzz sound!  If on the fence about it I would go with it."", 'Great price, lightweight, energy efficient. It has worked very well so far. The price was the best I found on Ebay. I think the design is very good. The shape of the dish plus the shiny interior helps it be much more efficient than a regular space heater. It gets very hot very fast. It also has a buzzer in case it tips over. A great all around heater to warm a person up fast.', ""These are fabulous heaters (radiant warmth, like the sun) and are in great condition.At first they didn't quite meet my needs, because I needed them to point straight ahead, whereas they are angled slightly upward and this is not adjustable. However, I set each heater on a slanted platform (which I made out of heavy cardboard), and now they meet my needs perfectly. (Parabolic heat dish heaters warm whatever is directly in front of them, within about, say, 15 feet.) You won't believe how much glowing warmth they put out!Also, Rob was great to do business with."", ""I live in a 1920's craftsman style house with poor insulation. This heater is wonderful and has allowed me to turn my thermostat down several degrees and still be comfortable here in Minnesota. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could because it is actually a little bit large to walk around in a small house with small rooms.  But that said, even set as low as it will go, it still puts out a lot of heat. In fact, I have to be careful not to put it in a room near my thermostat because the furnace will not come on at all if I do!  I have already recommended it to friends."", 'This heat dish pumps out heat so intensely it’s like a dryer for your cloths if sitting in front of it. I could feel it’s radiant heat from about 15ft away. Wayyyy better than other heat dish I had no contest. It does not oscillate and no remote only 2 features not on this probably because it is heavy duty. This is the best heat dish, look no further. ', ""I had a socially distanced bourbon tasting party for four on my back patio during January 2021 in Chicago. My neighbor had two of the Presto dishes so I ordered two more. Even though the evening's temperature dipped into the mid-20s, all four of us were completely comfortable sitting in our patio chairs with a our own Presto dish to keep us warm.

DeLonghi Ceramic Heater Quiet 1500 Watt Digital Adjustable 3 Heat Settings Box,40.0, ,"['LOVE this space heater!I have the larger model of this (Tower TCH7090ERD) for my house, so I decided to try the smaller model for my office.It has the SAME features but smaller, which is PERFECT.There\'s a remote control. It oscilates. There\'s an eco function (to help conserve energy). There\'s a timer to shut off AND turn on the space heater. There\'s an auto-off function if the heater tips over. There\'s an LED screen with the temperature and reads ""eco"" if the eco funtion is on/off. It\'s quiet. The heat can be HOT, which is nice! There are different modes which can turn on only the fan (no heat), eco/non-eco, and a non-freeze mode (maintains an area at a low temperature that\'s above freezing but not warm, used in rooms that are seldom inhabited or empty).I read LOTS of revies before purchasing this space heater and its larger model because I had a bad experience with a space heater a long time ago that nearly set my house on fire :( Since then, I\'ve avoided space heaters until these 2 models :) I anticipate that these will last a LONG time :) After they stop working, I\'ll probably stick to this brand/model :)VERY happy customer.', 'Real junk right out of the box.Hassle to return to Best buy.', 'The product may well be a very good piece of equipment ,but, it will not work on 240volts which is standard in the U.K. I believe that in order not to mislead customers you should specify the voltage of your equipment in your advertisement. I would then not wasted my money buying your 120volts heater.', 'great heater', 'GREAT', 'The heater is loud when it is on.   The fan is not strong.  The unit is not as good as what I thought.  Overall, I am unsatisfied with the unit all all.  I have a mini desk fan tower bought from costco.  It works good and quiet.']","Used: An item that has been used previously.

 Lasko Ceramic Electric Tower Heater with Multi-function Remote Control Portable,44.98,30-day returns,"[""Background: We moved into a basement after our previous residence caught fire. The basement is unfinished with one bedroom and a half bath, while the remainder of this exceptionally large space remains concrete floors and walls. The main area where we watch TV and interact together is significantly cold, usually around the low to mid-60s. I cannot handle cold, so after reading some reviews, I grabbed this. Note that the basement we are now residing in has a temporary wall set up to cut off about 2/3 of the basement, and again, it's a relatively large basement. (You could roller skate a little bit in the area behind the temporary wall). ReviewPROGRAMMABLE HEATER? No, this is not programmable in the manner in which I understood, though it's obviously possible that I could have mis-read. That said, there is a remote that allows you to set up a TIMER for the heater to remain running. It is not one that you can literally schedule/program heating times. SAFETY: More often, portable heaters have safety shut-off devices that kick in if the heater has been knocked over or if it is picked up. This does not. I would not dare leave this running unattended, regardless of what you are thinking reading this review, we all tend to run out of the room for a minute or two. Regardless, lack of safety feature is definitely a disadvantage.WARMTH: By itself, this made somewhat of a difference, but ultimately, it still was not very effective. We bought a second stationary heater from Costco and, when ran simultaneously with this rotating heater, the basement gets mostly comfortable after a couple hours. If you have the heater near you, it's definitely warm, but it may not be effective for a space much larger than what we are sitting at now with the temporary wall. POWER BILL: After approximately 2 weeks, we could not take the cold anymore with just one heater running, so we did have to purchase a second that is a stable heater found at Costco (small black and gray box with vents). I had not seen the power bill prior to us moving in; however, my assumption is that the jump was significant as our roommate was beside himself when he saw the power bill. CONCLUSION: I would say if you cannot access stable oil heaters or are wary of them, this is a good option, especially if you are dealing with a normal sized bedroom or mid-sized living area. The power bill definitely goes up. As far as price goes, I found out later that I could have purchased this for about 2/3 the price elsewhere, so before you buy, check prices on different websites. "", 'It really warms the area and the remote is great, as is the oscillating feature...I have had a Lasko heater like this and was so happy to see one like it for sale.

Mr. Heater F273704 Black Brass/Plastic Hose Assembly 1 Dia. in. x 10 L ft.,42.81,63 sold,"[""What I like about this hose: The quality seem very good.&amp; it seals great at both ends. So far I have user about 10x of the 20lb propane tanks through this hose without the (oil trapping) filter and my Mr. Heater - Flex still works as good as when it was brand new. The pilot lights instantly and the burner is ready to turn on within 5 seconds of lighting the pilot. Heater is not showing any signs of being clogged by the oils found the cheaper propane hoses. Per Mr. Heater If you're using a portable propane heater, this IS the hose to get &amp; it pays for itself with the first year. Yes it cost more but you do not need to buy the over priced and sometimes very hard to find disposable filters that Mr. heater recommends replacing every year. Since you payed good money for your heater, why not protect it from clogging by buying this good quality hose. When I bought my Mr Heater, the filters that all the other hoses require were out of stock at  Mr. Heater Lowes, Home Depot &amp; Amazon ect. and where I did find them they were between 2-4 times the normal price = ouch. With the supply chain issues (which could happen again) I didn't want to get stuck needing to use the heater but having to chance using it with a cheaper hose that can clog it with oil (if) I could not get a new filter in the years to come or having to re-use and old contaminated (saturated) filter. I think of this superior quality hose as a good insurance policy for the heater staying reliable for years to come.*What I don't like about it:Just 1 issue, On the package it says that handling it (probably the rubber? part) can expose the person to some gnarly chemicals and to wash the hands immediately after.  Maybe just wear some gloves. It would be nice if Mr. Heater could redesign this hose to have a more user friendly (less toxic) coating on the exterior."", 'Product was as described and a bit cheaper than other places had it listed for. Cant wait to take it camping with us now and run the heater all night with no worry of having to get up in the middle of the night and change little green bottles.

It does not blow it anywhere. called **.****** and they told me I am right, but it is supposed to keep the heat lower in the room. there is absolutely no difference. I also paid 30 some dollars for it on ****, when it is for sale everywhere else for $20 (Mr. heater brand).Shame on me! you can buy other heaters that blow heat straight out, I guess I just bought the name brand.', ""Keep expectations of a 3 to 4 inch plastic fan in check. And you will be happy with your purchase. Does not move much air. But the install was easy. And it's better than no fan. Install took 15 min. Remove metal plate on Mr.Heater install the fan. Attach thermostat wires inside unit. Screw in the 4 bolts that hold unit in place. Done. You got a fan in your Mr Heater Unit. I'm my opinion unit should be sold with fan installed. But they get an extra 30 bucks or so out of you by doing it this way. Overall I'm pleased though. The Heater works great along with Fan. I'd recommend it.  Heats the 800 square feet up quite well. Even on the lowest setting. No vent is nice. And no fumes. Clean burning. Excellent Very Happy. Thanks!"", ""Works very well on auto.  its not going to circulate the air in your garage, I have a small box fan 8ft above the heater blowing down across the garage for that.  I also shimmed my heater out 4in from the wall or the fan wouldn't be able to get air to blow any out.  It made a big difference"", 'It’s better than having the heater without the fan it does move some air but not a lot. The automatic function does not work on it with the heater for some reason, incompatibility or something? At full retail price it’s not a very good value. Don’t stand too close to the heater see photo.', 'Blower is a little loud but bearable but the biggest problem is this model will not work on auto feature in wall heaters made before 2015 so if you have an older stove the auto feature will not work because it does not have the thermostat built in the fan', 'Works as good as can be expected for its size.

"Lasko 1500W Ceramic Space Heater with Adjustable Thermostat, 754200, Silver",45.0, ,"['Been using it now for nearly 2 weeks; brutal Ohio winters make this a necessity.  It\'s compact, light and fits just about anywhere.  They do warn that it can discolor floors/carpets etc so I have it on top of a small waist-height cabinet with a piece of glass under it to protect the surface.  I\'m using it in a 12x12 office, and it is more than adequate to the task.  So far I\'ve used it on the first (lower power) setting at about a ""4"" heat setting (about 1/3 of max).  It puts out a tremendous amount of heat with a far reaching blower.  My only reservation is that it\'s a bit loud compared to my old heatwe (a trusty Bionaire I\'d had for about 12 years which finally gave up the ghost).   Can\'t comment on quality/longevity yet but for the money, it\'s a great buy and I recommend it.  As with any portable heating product, I would not run this when no one is in the room to monitor it. ', ""It serves my purpose very well.  My feet are perpetually cold, and these are perfect for that.  These units last a good 3 to 4 years before they start to get a little less efficient and effective. Eventually they do stop working.  Brand new, these are great heaters.  Very quiet heating unit.  Fan isn't overly loud and puts out a good amount of heat at the low setting.  I rarely use it at the high setting until it starts getting older.  I have gone thru 2 of these units in a 10 to 11 year period.  My 2nd one (about 5 years old) is starting to waiver.  I'd suggest getting some compressed air and blowing out the dust that collects at the intake on the rear of the unit to make it last longer.  The one thing I wish it had was a safety sensor that automatically turns it off if it gets tipped over. It does NOT have any safety feature so be mindful about leaving it on!"", 'I bought a pair of these just in case I experienced a furnace problem and needed some heat while getting it repaired or perhaps wanted to heat the garage a bit while working there.  They seem well built, run very quietly and would likely produce 1500 watts at 120 volts (I got 1440 at 117.7 volts).  The lower setting produced about 930 watts at 119 volts.  The cord is 16 AWG with 105C rating, which appears adequately sized.  Although I did not test them for very long, the heaters and fan did turn off when the temperature setting was reduced to a very low level.  My only qualm, for which I reduced a star,  is that there is no switch to turn them off if overturned.  I rotated the units in all directions, but they kept running.  So I would make sure that they are not used on a flammable surface or any possible source of overturning is excluded.  I did not test if the overheating reset would ever turn them off.', 'This heater did a nice job of heating my area at work.  I sit near an outside wall that is very cold some days.  This heater kept me toasty for about six hours then blew the circuit breaker at work.  This item could be improved with an internal resettable circuit breaker protruding from the rear so IT would blow instead of the one at work.  That would be more convenient instead of me being required to call an electrician at work to fix the work breaker.', 'Great little heater that puts out a lot of heat. I live in a converted space that has no central heating, so this little guy is my only source of heat and it does great. Keeps me toasty all night long at about 1/3 of maximum. My only caveat is that it has no tip-over protection. If the dog brushes against the back of it and knocks it over, it does not automatically shut off.', 'Bought this so we did not have to run the heater all night. This little heater works GREAT. Keeps are room at whatever temperature we set the knob at and heats up our master bedroom FAST. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because after we unplug it from the outlet, the actual plug is HOT. We had to switch to a power strip as we were afraid the heater might blow a fuse as it seems to use a lot of electricity to power.', 'For a small heater it does a really good job.  It is also excellent for small rooms.  The only perk is that the handle is too smallto get a good hold.  But overall great little heater, love the feature it turns on and off automatically by it self when needed!', ""Prior owner. This is the best small space heater. This warms an area very fast. It isn't heavy. The face does get warm. Please just be careful. I recv'd this very quickly. It is really a fair price. Very well built. The previous space heater is still working, about 7 years now. I was just tired of moving it around. It IS that good. Buy this heater. You won't regret this. Just be careful. Thank you!"", ""This little heater will run you out of a 500 sq ft room if left on high. It's no joke. Lasko is a decent brand, not high end but should last 2-3 years....or more but for for 20.00 what would you expect. Dials are easy and built in temperature regulator is a must. I love mine and think it's a great value. I once ran a lasko fan straight 24 hrs - 7 days a week for 2 years without any issue. It started to rust from the moisture in the area or it would probably still be running. Good purchase and I am very pleased."", ""I think a lot of space heaters between 20-40$ are all the similar, they all break or are just as good as broken by the end of the season. This space heater seems of much better quality, even the material seems of high quality, instead of plastic like most. I also like that it's small and wisper quite. I have no complaints. I got it for 20$ which was a fantastic deal but I would have paid 35$ or even more for a heater with this quality. My biggest pro is the size.  Love it!!!""]","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear. The item may be missing the original packaging or protective wrapping, or may be in the original packaging but not sealed.

Comfort Zone CZQTV007BK 1500W Radiant Quartz Heater - Black,44.0,Last item available,"[""This a very cost effective space heater to warm any area during a chilly winter, or - as we had during the early part of the Wisconsin spring - a slightly nippy start to spring. It works to warm a bedroom, normal sized living room (unsure of those with an open plan large setting), or a small area of a basement that you are working in. It has three settings, and has tip-over &amp; overheat protection. I like this product an awful lot, and thus I'll give it 4.5 stars. It does NOT have a remote, but I bought a separate one for that purpose. I am taking a half of a star off because EVEN though it does have tip over protection (meaning it shuts off in that case), it is slightly more easy to tip over than I thought it was. So if you have pets, it might NOT be the BEST idea to use it when they are out playing - NOT so much for safety sake, but to prevent your fur baby from getting injured stepping on it."", 'Works very well and set up takes only a few minutes...', ""This will be my last one.

Cyclone Booster Fan Plus With Built In Thermostat In White For All Seasons NEW,45.0,30-day returns,"['Bought this booster fan to direct warm air into a utility room that has no heat.  I ran a short duct from my den, through a closet, and into the utility room.  I installed the booster in the duct opening in the utility room and it works like a charm.

A few minutes after the heat in the den shuts off, the booster fan shuts off.Overall a nice booster fan that runs quiet, efficiently, and gets the job done.', 'Bought for a room farthest from my furnace.

Indus-Tool Model CL Under Desk Foot Warmer Tested BS3,,30-day returns,"[""In a Northern state, I've got an expensive office and the brilliant engineers designed a heating system with freezing cold floors. Not only that, constantly getting in and out of the car means inevitable snow on one's shoes in bad weather. This is a prescription for cold feet.This product is ideal for the job. Made of rubber so it's impervious to water or stains, cranks out the heat on high and trolls along beautiful on low. Plus, it's good size, bigger than the cheapie models so you don't have to think about where your feet are placed. Great value and highly recommended."", ""This rubber mat is excellent. I use it under my desk to keep my feet warm. It gets very hot. I believe around 135 degrees is what the mat heats up to. So this isn't some cheap mat that kinda gets warm.You can use it to warm your boots up also. The mat is injection molded one piece so it is water proof also. Would probably work great at the front door to melt snow or ice also."", ""Bought because our 70 yr. old house hardwood floors aren't insulated. This product is durable heats evenly perfect on cold nights to keep my feet warm in front of the tv. Did put down a piece of cardboard beneath the mat and floor as suggested by a previous purchaser's comment do not know if necessary. Have been using for weeks works great waterproof is a bonus, easy to keep clean.      arkansas"", 'The foot warmer arrived in a large, flat cardboard carton. Its switch (from high to low wattage and off) works well. This is the second one I have bought, both not for my feet but for my outdoor dogs/cats. Though it was not guaranteed for pets it works well in dog houses when the temperature is at 10 degrees F. Since it is sturdy for standing on with work shoes it also is tough enough for cats and dogs to sleep on. I put a special wrap on the AC wire to it to prevent animals from damaging the cord and usually use it at the low wattage setting. It is much more sturdy than the electric pet pads that are being sold.', 'My significant other has an office area just outside of our main house, the floor is cold and so were her feet until we put one of these mats under her desk and another by her photo tent.  Now her feet are warm and she is happy, so am I.  The wide range of heat settings and heavy construction make this a good purchase.', ""It's perfect!!!We live in Wisconsin with cold winter day's and night's. Hot water heat in our home so under the table gets real chilly because of having tile flooring.This unit is great because its warm enough to feel, yet not so warm you need to keep turning it on and off.I was also happy to see it had a lighted on/off switch about in the middle of the cord.If your legs ever get cool or cold under a desk or table, buy this unit!!!I wish I had it years ago and saved on the electric bill for the small heater I was using."", 'I repair watches my semi finished basement and I  have struggled trying to keep my feet and legs warm as my bench is against an outside wall. Have had an unheated rubber pad on the floor and it helped somewhat but this electric pad is great, l can actually sit in comfort even without shoes or extra pairs of socks.  Actually warms the air space for my legs too! Only used it for a few weeks but I am very impressed. Hope it lasts a long time.', ""It's a little hot for my feet in socks so I just folded up a bath floor towel into 1/4's and it's perfect in my basement office during the winter. I also use it with a Woods 50030 Indoor Countdown Timer so I never have to worry about leaving it on. Great product."", 'Take your shoes off and enjoy this foot pad on the coldest of days!!! Nice! And it has a handy on/off switch half way up the cord!!', ""I bought two of these foot warmers. One in March and one in May 2021.March purchased died in aprx September.May purchased survived till March 2022.Both were once placed under the table and never moved, so it's not a miss-use or broken cable. We always switched them off after several hours of use.Make your own judgment if it's acceptable. I don't think so.On the bright side - when it works it, well, works, keeping your feet warm.""]","Used: An item that has been used previously.

Lasko 1500W Electric Portable Ceramic Tower Heater Remote Control Oscillation,45.0, ,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater. And If I have to replace any one of the heaters I have, it will be with a Lasko 5572 heater.HJ of Missouri', ""We were absolutely thrilled with the size and capability of this room heater.  It's a little taller than the other Lasko portable heater and our decision to get it was a good one. For our needs, this one is perfect. "", 'I really enjoy my heater.  I live in Arizona where it is getting cooler at night now.  It is very efficient and quiet.', 'Heats small area immediately in the morning, with an increase of 5-10 degrees in temperature within 15 minutes.  Easy to operate, with remote.  As usual: follow directions in the manufacturers manual for best results!', ""Wow, does this put out some heat, and like now..  Don't have to wait for anything to warm up  immediate heat..  2 modes low 900w and high 1500w..  Plus you can set it from 39 degrees to 90 degrees and to kick on automatically if room gets below set temp..  This can almost heat my whole house..  Will prob heat at least 3 rooms.Led readouts are bright and clear, fan, remote, oscillates, has real buttons, not plastic film that will wear out, and stands tall.  Has handle for easy moving.. With gas prices doubling this winter, I'm turning to a space heater so I can lower the thermostat.. "", 'great heater, used it all winter, no problems, good price, fast delivery', ""I don't have this exact model, but I have two similar Lesco 1500w heaters w/digital displays w/remotes.  I bought the second one because one of our tenants lost the remote.  One is #5165, the other one is #755320, the only complaint I have on this model is I had to stick a piece of foam tale on the top of the carrying slot in back so my finger wouldn't slip out of the carrying slot when carrying the heater.  The other heater's slot is angled so your fingers don't slip out.  The one remote does control either heater.  I recommended my satisfaction to a friend and he bought one and is happy with it.  I don't know his model #. I've had the first hater 5 yrs and the second one 2 yrs and both work great."", ""Great heater. Warms my garage better than expected.

"NEW Lasko Electric Oscillating Ceramic Tower Space Heater, 1500-Watt, 5307",, ,"['I live in Oakland, California in the USA. The usual temperature here during winter nights goes between 35 to 40 something degrees Fahrenheit. I use it to warm up a small room (10 feet x 10 feet x 8 feet, without insulation). I usually turn it on with maximum temperature and speed for around 20 minutes. The room would be heat up to reasonably warm. Usually, I could turn the heater off for about half an hour before I need to turn it on again.', 'Great small room space heater.  Simple controls.  Quiet but not so quiet you forget and leave it on.  Only wish I knew heating watts on the low heat setting.  Have not put the thermostat into use yet...maybe try to use it/get the heater cycling at some warm bathroom temperature in the winter.', ""This unit is closely-related to the one (same brand &amp; features) I've been using these past 5+ years.  A reliable workhorse, with a bonus: It turns into a no-heat fan in the summer!!  Fits compactly under my desk."", 'This little heater has amazing power. It is small . I use it on a medium setting and it heats a very large area. No need to turn it all the way up. I’m very happy with this heater.', ""I've had many space heaters over the years, but this one is a gem: a high-quality product that works well and quickly. It's the quietest heater I've ever had. The oscillating heating tower guarantees the whole room gets warm. The tower design is sleek, and the whole unit takes up little space. This machine has heft and seems well made. Though it's about 3-times taller than it is wide, most of the weight is in the base, which makes it feel solid and not prone to tipping over easily. I'm so in love with this baby that I'm buying a second -- FOR MY 3-ROOM APARTMENT!! lolI wholeheartedly recommend this product."", ""Received this tower fan and it's very sturdy, has several settings: air, low heat and higher heat. Large enough to heat a medium sized room; only complaint is it smells a bit antiseptic."", 'I have not actually used my LASKO 5370 Ceramic/ Oscillating Heater yet. I purchased the LASKO Name. Have always had longevity with their products. I highly recommend.', ""Very appropriate for heating a small space - generates desired heat; good price and good design...would have been rated a '5 star' if it has an auto shut off when desired room temp is reached."", 'This product works well, is easy to move around to different locations, and keeps me cozy when I am chilled.  I would recommend it to others!  ', ""Almost bought the more expensive model because it came with a remote. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and found one in here! Remote doesn't come with batteries though, so have AAAs handy.<br&gt;It's relatively quiet, heats up the room quickly, and the thermostat works pretty well. It was so good that I ordered a second one for the living room area.

Mr. Heater Portable Buddy Carry Bag 9BX,40.02, ,"['Be aware that this bag is much wider than the heater that it is designed for!  You can put the heater in easily and still have about 5"" of room within the bag on the end.  This is not a problem but will allow the heater to move around within the bag and because the bag is floppy, it is not quite as nice looking as it would be if everything fit better.  You have room to put an extra couple of tanks in there, or a large thermos!I actually plan on using the extra space for an extra tank and a portable CO2 detector with lithium batteries for it.Other than that the bag is of good quality and has plenty of room to store tanks on the ends and a spot for a hose so that you can use larger propane tanks.', ""The only thing that I see is less that good is that the hook and loop closure comes apart and doesn't stay together.
