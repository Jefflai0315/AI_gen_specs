I wouldn't say it was overly hot but it made the room to at least a comfortable temperature. "", ""What I like most about his is:1a) it is a colour1b) it is red. Why do we not have a whole rainbow of colours for this type of heater?2) it gives out a hefty amount of heat. I have only ever needed to use it at the lowest setting to heat my bathroom.3) It has character. The design of this heater actually adds to the interest of the room. It doesn't try to be a hidden addition.Warning! - It creaks and clicks while it is heating up, so be aware of this if you are a light sleeper and it is close to your bed. Update - now I've used it daily for 2½ months, it seems to have completely stopped clicking and ticking."", 'Very good, gives adjustable heat and pretty quick,  for a small rad it is surprisingly good.

Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,73.29,281 sold,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

Electric Space Heater 1500W Garage Forced Air Fan Portable Utility Home Shop,74.97, ,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.

I obviously didn't lok too hard at the dimensions, as it's absolutely tiny. I grew up with electric oil-filled radiators that ran the length of a room, so find it odd it's so hard to find anything bigger of this shape. The metal seems thin, so I'm  not surprised others have complained of leaks developing. Again, I don't remember the ones I grew up with ever having a problem.

We\'ll see how it does when temperature here in the American Midwest reaches 18 degrees below zero  I hae it ina small chicken house within an old milkshed that I\'m completing Styrofoam insulation, hopefully before winter sets in.  So far, the all is well with the temp down to 37 degrees a couple nights.   It is supplemented by two steady red heat lights and another thermostatically controlled heater by another manufacturer.  Meantime, pardon the ironic ""sweating an expected hard winter"" situation!   I do highly recommend this space heater and am sure it will work out for any close space.  Beats space heaters with hot elements hands down for safety.', 'Bought this heater in October. Have used it for a month inside a small bedroom (10 x 12 feet). Not an ideal heater for high heat needs. Eg. It helped the temp in the bedroom not drop so low that we wake up cold (was 28degF low this past week), however when set at its max heat setting all night long, the max temp inside room in the morning was 58-59F. So, not adequately warm. Our bedroom door was tightly shut and has only one window that is closed.Pros:Silent. Very light weight, so portable. Cuts off if tipped over even slightly at an angle or when knocked down to floor.Saves money on electricity!!Cons:Not adequate heating. Best heat if you stand right on top of it, between your legs :-)', 'This heater is light and slim.  It can fit in narrow spots however I would not recommend putting it in position that is close to other items.It is very hot and does NOT radiate heat like other oil heaters.  It is hot because the heat is not radiated out away from the heater.It does keep the ""chill"" of the bathroom however the cost of operating it may be higher than other radiator heaters.  I say this because more heat generation requires more electricity.I bought two of these and might put them in the trash because I don\'t know anyone I\'d want to bless with these ill-performing heaters.', ""I was looking for a small space heater for a back room in my house that doesn't benefit from the furnace heat.  The size of this heater is great, and it keeps the room at a nice even temperature. It's nice and compact. The one drawback I have found is the legs that accompany it are plastic, and over time the heat softens them, causing the heater to lean backward or forwards, which in my opinion is unsafe since it could possibly fall over. The effect of the heat on the legs is quite noticeable. The manufacturer should consider making the legs out of a material that is heat resistant."", 'i purchased the newair portable space heater for additional heat in main room.  my first oil filled heater.  it seems to making sounds like a hot water radiator, and the surface of heater is too hot.  will donate it to local charity', 'I have this in my bathroom to help with the cold in the morning.

So far, this unit is great.  It keeps the whole RV about 10-degrees above ambient, with no noise.  It is just 400-watt, so it will never keep up with a 1500W \'blowers\'.It is quite compact.ONE ISSUE.  The surface gets quite hot (~ 150-deg?).

NEW Duraheat TT-360 360 Degree Propane LP Tank Top Heater w Variable Heat ,74.95,50 sold,"['This heater works wonderfully.  Love it.  Could not get it to start at first set on low but starts very easily when set on medium.  Puts out good lateral heat, so it works well to gather around it,   Other heaters I considered, most of the heat goes strait up into the air.  ', ""Just got this and tried it twice this afternoon. I do not have the nerve to try it again. It assembles to the tank easily. Lights easily and burns for about three minutes on low just perfectly. Then you hear a small roaring sound that last for another 60 seconds, the BAM. Sounds like a small explosion. I think I might sit it out in the middle of my back yard and see what happens if I don't jump to shut it down immediately like I did twice today. Looks like a Chinese bomb to me. "", ""Mount is not strong.  It works but I think more heat goes up in warm air than is radiated.  Heaters with metal radiators don't work as well as ones with ceramic elements."", 'The best type of heater for your patio or deck. 360 degree heat area. Low setting is always plenty. Parts are easy to find. ', ""Love it!  We have quite a few propane tanks hanging around, so all we needed to do was get this and put it on top.  Heats up quickly.  We hang out outside and use this to keep warm.  We have the tall propane heater as well, but this one is lower and heats your midsection.  At this price, it's a great bargain!"", ""Works great. The only thing is I couldn't light it through the hole and just directly on the burner works well."", 'This space heater does the job I need it to do.  Heat output is very adequate.  3 heat settings on an easy to read dial.  Assembly was easy.  Attaching it to the tank was easy.  Heat output is straight up in a fairly narrow column, so I made a metal spreader that sits on top to widen the heat plume.', 'TT-360 Duraheat works awesome, easy light (match), 3 settings and plenty of heat for my work area.

On the other hand it gives off about 1/20 of the heat.Just be aware, before you buy, that it is not a space heater. If your legs were under a small desk or in a box, it may have some value. I would not recommend it for ANY other application or anything for that matter!  Forget about it.', ""This doesn't put out fabulous amounts of heat.  It does work to keep my feet warm, but the effect is extremely subtle.  One minor niggle is that the power switch is several feet down the power cord from the unit.  It would be more convenient if the power switch was ON the unit.  I would buy this unit again."", 'I bought this vertical leg heater for my wife who spends a lot of time on a laptop.

Electric Portable Heater 1500-Watt Oscillating Ceramic Tan with Remote Control,74.8,Last item available,"[""This is the 3rd purchase of the same heater.  1st for one of my sons, 2nd for my boss and 3rd to replace a noisy old heater at my desk.  Not only does it produce heat well but it is also is aesthetically pleasing in an office setting.  Those points combined with many levels of heat to chose from and a remote control feature to boot...perfection!!  Three purchases and each for less than $60...it's a winner!!"", ""The reason I wanted this heater was I needed supplemental heat to my daughters room which is the furthest from the central heating system and surrounded by three ouside walls. Have been using a small oscillating ceramic heater for a couple years, but not thermostat controlled. Love the Lasko, cause it heats room evenly and quickly! Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature. If you can run it on High which draws 12-14 Amps then it will work well for you! Why they disable temperature controlled operation in Low mode is baffling to me! ', 'This heater is a pretty good source of additional warmth where you need it. You may get tired of people asking you what it is though... It will not heat an entire home, but in my 22x28 living room, it does a pretty good job warming things up. Quiet and pretty. The remote works great, (even though it is almost as weird of a shape as the heater).', ""The heater is very dependable , I've had one for 1 year now. I have purchased two additional for other rooms. These units do the job of heating rooms well. They're very fashionable convenient."", 'first off gotta say this heater warms a medium size room very fast..and very wellalso easy to operate. only problem is the heater is very noise. looked over the reviewspeople said very quit very little sound NOT true loud fan and when oscillating is onmakes a verroom verroom sound [ best way to describe it]  gonna need to get out theear plugs gave it four stars for its heating', ""This little heater is great for taking the chill out of the air. My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me. (Don't rely on this heater being your main source of heat but rather as a supplement)."", ""expertbenefitsI haven't had it too long but it fits my purpose. I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable. It kind of cute too!"", 'I like the design of the heater very much and it certainly has enough output to heat what I intended it for.  I also like the features that it offers.  The only thing that I wish it did and it does not do is turn back on when the thermostat goes below what it is set at as well as turn off when it reaches the temperature.  All in all though, it is a good value and I have been pleased with it.', ""Granted it's not more than 1000 square feet, but this pretty little heater sits in the center of my house and keeps the whole house comfortable.  It has a thermostat,  (only 5 degree increments) but still will save me money by shutting off when the room is warm enough.  It has a convenient remote control.

CZQTV5M Ceiling Mount Heater - Quantity 1,73.65,12 watchers,"['I already had one of these so I knew what I was getting.  There was a problem with both units.  The arm that attaches to the sides was installed backwards.  In other words, it was in front of the heating element.  They have about a 90 degree tuning angle.  It had to be taken apart and the base arms rotated 180 degree so the bracket would actually be behind the unit (like the picture shows).  Luckily, I am handy enough to do that.  The units work great but draw a lot of power.  At 1500 watts, a standard house breaker can only handle 2 (if you are lucky) with nothing else turned on. Running 3 units on the 750 watt setting is the best you can ask for.', 'Heater appears to be flimsy and cheaply made. That being said, it seems to work fine. But I have not used it a lot.  Makes me wonder how long it will continue to work.  But for the price, I can not complain. It does its job.  This is a very inexpensive heater.  It is important to have it pointed in the correct direction since it heats surfaces and I am the surface wanting to be heater. I would have liked it better if it could have been angled better, but it seems to have built in tilting restrictions.  The included LED light is cheap, very dim, and close to worthless.  But on the whole I am still happy.  Would I buy it again?  Depends on its longevity. If it lasts more than 3 years, yes.', 'It is well made, the price is a little excessive. It heats well, but only good for a small area. You can mount it several different ways, which is a plus.', ""I have used this type heater in my home shop for the last 15 years and it has done a great job. This past summer I built a 12' X 12' gazebo and I enclosed it for the winter so the kids can use it for a play house and still we cook in there with a electric grill. Since I have used this type heater for several years I decided to buy one for the gazebo and I am glad I did, it does a great job and it was a very good price."", 'Pros, heats well and radiates s good 10 feet plus,  two heat ranges 750 and 1500 watts, pull cord is perfect length for rafter mounting, power cord is long and high quality.    Cons, halogen light is bright and annoying but does not light up any significant space in the room, bracket system is ultra flimsy. Bracket assembly is ratcheted and only goes in one direction. You will break it unless your one in a million that reads bad language Chinese instructions, halogen bulb burns out frequently, are near impossible to find, and cost 8 dollars each. ', 'Really Gets the Heat Out! Ceiling Mount Using the Center Bolt ONLY, and You can Pivot and Swivel, to Aim the Heat at any Spot in a Cold Garage. The Heat Reaches Out 15+ Feet.

We Warm Quartz Infrared Heater 1500 Watts Large Remote Control HT1013US ,70.0, ,"['This heater was bought to heat a 12x14 room and it works perfect.  it keeps the room warm and comfortable.  I have been very pleased with the performance and would recommend it.  also i feel it is safe for kids to be around it. ', ""I haven't had my two heaters very long but I can tell you they work really really well., They have a pretty good fan that blows the heat a good distance for a heater that size. Well worth the money!!"", 'I love it 1 heats my 29ft Travel Trailer and 2 of them heat my 34ft 5th Wheel...I really appreciate your product.January 2019, the beginning of the month we had an issue with the fan in one of the Heaters and the other one started making the same noise.  I called the company and they were great with me. I really felt good about the company. I sent them both back as a set and with no hassle they sent me another set. I had the choice of the money or another sent. I picked another sett because they work exolent, no issues and like I said it heats my 29ft Travel Trailer. The other one was put in our 34ft 5th Wheel and It worked great also. I am very happy about these heaters...Thank you so much for standing behind your words. It is very well appreciated by us.', 'These heaters work pretty well. I use them in my garage to keep it warm when I’m working . Only drawback is that they will kick your GFI every so often. I’m not sure if they over draw current ? But I’ve had to reset my breaker several times after I was left in the dark garage after they blew my breaker. Nice thermostat that’s pretty accurate, nice quick heat up, blower fairly strong. They are not near as good as a 220Volt or gas heater. But for the price you get 2. At retailers you pay this  price for 1. All in all a strong 8.5/10. I don’t use it everyday so I’m sure it will last.', 'I live in a block house and it is cold in the winter time and  expensive to keep warm. This heater does a really good job keeping a large room warm.  I get daily reports on how much electricity I use each day from the electric company and my daily Kilowatt usage did not go up that much when I started using the heater. I think this heater is a very good choice. I plan to purchase another one for  my closed in porch area. I am a cold natured person and I recommend this heater.', 'Small in size.....good and bad. Not so sure about large room claim. Would probably run constantly. Recommendation more positive than negative......but not by much.', 'Furnace in a box. We were having some issues with our furnace &amp; this item was the deal of the day. not wanting to have frozen pipes, I ordered one. Very easy to use and effective for even a large room or basement. If you are lazy, the remote is a plus. looks good and preforms the task. Nice product at a super price.', ""Just got it today, It really does not put out very much heat in my very small office,very disappointed with this product. It has a remote and buttons on the front of the unit, seems like it has no effect on it whatsoever. My office is 6'X15 and it is 39 degrees here and it is not real warm in here now."", ""I have a very large open living room and kitchen, probably 1200 sq ft together and 2 of these heat do a pretty good job of keeping it warm.  I have my main house heater set of 62 and these 2 heater set to 67.  They kick on and off as they should and keep the main house heater usage down.  Probably work really good if I had 3 of these for this space.

DuraHeat Portable Electric Space Heater 1500-Watt Pivoting Base,74.52,30-day returns,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time. I put the heater in max mode and not matter what it just wasn't throwing out enough heat.You literally have to be right in front of the heater to feel anything. I wanted something affordable that was not powered by propane however they do say u get what you paid for."", ""I bought two of these for my garage and disregarded the previous reviews i read. The fan barely puts air out. It gets hot, but the fan almost seems like the motor is junk. I'll still use it. I'll just put a box fan behind it so it can actually move heat around."", ""The heater is built well and is safe however its useless in a garage or outdoors. I would recommend it for use in a indoor room or basement environment where it doesn't have to compete with more harsh temperatures. Not exactly what I was hoping for!"", 'This looks good in the pictures, but is a terrible heater. The forced air is a joke. Plus it does not get hot. With the thermostat on high, after 15 minutes, I could still hold my hand about six inches in front of the grill. Very disappointed.', 'I thought I was going to buy this to upgrade the heater I use at work in the shop. I ended up just putting it in my car that I’m working on on the side of my house. It gets to about 80° inside just a car. I don’t expect it would be able to heat the shop. The fan is very weak as well.', 'It is good product for the price, it is slow on heating a large area but keeps it at a good temperature.', 'It came in a timely manner and works great as long as its pointed at you.

It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature. If you can run it on High which draws 12-14 Amps then it will work well for you! Why they disable temperature controlled operation in Low mode is baffling to me!

My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me.

I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable.

Presto Heat Dish Plus Parabolic Electric Heater 0792401 - TESTED WORKING ,74.99, ,"[""I use this heater in my clinic and my patients absolutely love it. It's amazing how quickly it heats a room without air blasting or noise. It has a nice safety feature where it makes a horrible noise if it's tipping over (it only happens if I'm moving it when it's on). In fact several of my patients have gone out and bought their own for home. I should get a commission."", 'I have an old 1911 craftsman style house with no insulation.  My heating system is an outdated oil furnace.  As we all know the price of fuel is always fluctuating and seems like it is going to stay that way.  It costs me about $300.00 a month in the winter.  Which is ridiculous, especially when the heat just does not stay in the house for long.I needed a knew plan and changing out the heat system or insulating the house is not an option at this time.  So I went out and bought the presto heatdish.  It produces so much heat that during the winter I no longer had to heat the entire house to stay warm.  I would just carry the heatdish around with me, saving me hundreds of dollars month to month.  I had a few other electric heaters before I purchased this one and the difference is night and day.I  have had this heater for almost 3 years now and it still works as well as the day I purchased it.  It paid for itself in its first week work.  With as much use as this gets I would of expected it to burn out a while ago, but that is not the case.The drawbacks: It does not have an automatic turn off system if it were to fall over, but it does have an alarm that is unmistakably loud.   There is also a footlight that you cannot turn off or on, but you can just take out the lightbulb if that bothers you.Great product and highly recommended. Thanks for reading.', ""Proven, ancient technology that outperforms the daylights of newer, highly rated products. It's effective (heats the room quickly and thoroughly), efficient (only 1,000 watts), safe (automatic shut-off features), and built to last. Sometimes a product cannot be improved upon.  "", 'It gives off a good amount of heat but it has one big design flaw where the dish can not be tilted. This means the dish is in a fixed position which points into the air slightly. So if the surface you place it on is taller than you are while seated you will struggle to feel it. The safety tip over buzzer also prevents you from sliding something underneath it to tilt it yourself.', ""This is a wonderful heater.  I am a smoker and visit my family a lot.  I choose to smoke in the garage there and my sister in law bought this for me to use in the garage. It warms up quickly for the immediate area and it doesn't take long for the surrounding areas to warm up either. Once this gets going I don't even need a coat.  (Ohio area)  I have a house with very tall ceilings in the master bedroom and living area.  In the winter this little heater warms up quickly, even going right to the high setting.  I always have to turn it way back too.  I am widowed now and I don't need to keep the entire house warm, just where I am.  I do recommend this.  Oh, it is safe, if you move it at all when it is on you get a loud buzz sound!  If on the fence about it I would go with it."", 'Great price, lightweight, energy efficient. It has worked very well so far. The price was the best I found on Ebay. I think the design is very good. The shape of the dish plus the shiny interior helps it be much more efficient than a regular space heater. It gets very hot very fast. It also has a buzzer in case it tips over. A great all around heater to warm a person up fast.', ""These are fabulous heaters (radiant warmth, like the sun) and are in great condition.At first they didn't quite meet my needs, because I needed them to point straight ahead, whereas they are angled slightly upward and this is not adjustable. However, I set each heater on a slanted platform (which I made out of heavy cardboard), and now they meet my needs perfectly. (Parabolic heat dish heaters warm whatever is directly in front of them, within about, say, 15 feet.) You won't believe how much glowing warmth they put out!Also, Rob was great to do business with."", ""I live in a 1920's craftsman style house with poor insulation. This heater is wonderful and has allowed me to turn my thermostat down several degrees and still be comfortable here in Minnesota. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could because it is actually a little bit large to walk around in a small house with small rooms.  But that said, even set as low as it will go, it still puts out a lot of heat. In fact, I have to be careful not to put it in a room near my thermostat because the furnace will not come on at all if I do!  I have already recommended it to friends."", 'This heat dish pumps out heat so intensely it’s like a dryer for your cloths if sitting in front of it. I could feel it’s radiant heat from about 15ft away. Wayyyy better than other heat dish I had no contest. It does not oscillate and no remote only 2 features not on this probably because it is heavy duty. This is the best heat dish, look no further. ', ""I had a socially distanced bourbon tasting party for four on my back patio during January 2021 in Chicago. My neighbor had two of the Presto dishes so I ordered two more. Even though the evening's temperature dipped into the mid-20s, all four of us were completely comfortable sitting in our patio chairs with a our own Presto dish to keep us warm. The next day I ordered two more dishes to complete my set.""]","Used: An item that has been used previously.

Heated Foot Warmer Black Cozy Toasty Toes 105 Watt 120 Volt New and Improved,70.0,30-day returns,"[""First, a Toasty Toes draws 105 watts (not 90) and is warranted for ONLY 6 MONTHS (not 1 year).OK, so the minimal warranty, particularly on this basic an item, suggests that you're probably not getting a first class product, and its shoddy factory packaging which makes you look twice to make sure you haven't gotten open-box merchandise - The tape doesn't even stick to the cardboard! - confirms it.I called the company and was told that my Toasty Toes should get to 120º on its low heat setting and 140º on high.Nope!!! I've had two of them: the first one didn't get much past 100º...went back, and the second one got to 120º, but no higher...also went back. (The high heat option may work only when the unit is vertical, but I obviously haven't been able to find out.)As far as I can tell, they're using an unique design/cute name combo as an excuse to charge WAAAY TOO MUCH MONEY for an INFERIOR PRODUCT! :(My observations about my Toasty Toes insofar as it worked: I was hoping it would compensate for a cold floor draft, but I found that in its horizontal position it warmed the bottoms of my feet while leaving the tops cold, which left them pretty uncomfortable...not at all what I had hoped for.And in its vertical position it was inadequate on its low heat setting, and I'm not about to buy a third one (Softball rules: two strikes, and you're out!) in the hope that it may actually work both as it's supposed to and as I'd like.Looks like it's back to my ancient, reliable 600 watt radiant jobby, and damn the electricity bills, full comfort ahead! :)"", 'I read previous reviews of the earlier model of this item saying it did not get warm enough to feel through your shoes. (It worked OK with socks or bare feet).  That is why I bought the newer model having 104 Watts. (The box design is different than the older model.)  It does keep your feet warm even with shoes on.  (It takes a few minutes to warm up.)  It is sturdy, has two heat settings, and can be used in three positions.  (The two different pairs of legs fold out from the bottom.)  It does everything it is supposed to do.  I can not want more than that.  It has a six month warranty.', 'Actually keeps your feet warm.  I do a lot of computer work and my feet get sooooooo cold.  When your feet are warm, the rest of you stays warm.  Best with slippers.   tested with killawat tester.  97 watts at medium, 195 watts at high.  to stay warm for less than a hundred watts is a miracle.   I use as medium and have to take feet off periodically to cool down.  This is so wonderful. Thanks Cozy Products.', ""The product is sturdy and works well.  It includes two legs that let it incline at a sharper angle.  The legs don't latch very well but if don't need that feature, it is very good."", 'It does the job keeping my feet warm.Would be improved if it had an automatic off after x hours and/or more than one temperature setting.', 'This is exactly what I needed for my office in the winter.Even on low I sometime need to take my shoes off the footrest to let them cool off!I have been using it two weeks and so far even forgetting to turn it off over night has not hurt it at all.', ""It's made well but wow, does this get hot!

Lasko Space Heater Convection Automatic Air Flow Electric Portable 1500 Watt New,74.95, ,"[""With the cold grip of a long winter making the house too chilly to stay comfortable, I looked for some space heaters to help out the central A/C system. After checking out just about all of the available products on the market, I spotted the Lasko 5812 heater on Ebay- the ONLY one I could find that directs warm air into the room from the bottom of the unit at floor level. For its size, this compact ceramic heater does a good job of keeping my feet warm and taking the chill out of any room where it is employed. A bigger than expected fan motor, quiet operation and good performance makes this a 'top pick' portable heater for the price."", ""Best heater on the market, so far. Heat where ever you put it very efficiently to the point, at times, I findmyself turning it down. Have one in my room, and the bathroom, which I let my brother hold for his room, so gonna get another for the bathroom, and one for the kitchen, because we're rarely in the living room. We're able to turn the gas hear off for the entire winter, and use it only to cook and wash clothes, with agas bill of less than $40 a month. The electric is a little higher than normal due to the heater, but nowherenear what utilities would normally cost with the gas included. So yes, this heater does actually save you a lot of money in other areas. And it's extremely sturdy, with a tip over mechanism that works even if the heater is slightly tilted.  Highly recommend. "", ""This has been the very best room heater i have ever purchased it keeps the whole room very warm i can even feel it from 5 feet away constructed like a regular furnace but much smaller don't let the size fool you this little heater will put out the heat baby and i will be buying more of them if they are still in stock i would recommend the Lasko 5812 anytime. thanks guys for a great deal that was well worth every penny."", 'It is the most powerful heater I have owned. The first Lasko 5812 lasted 8 and one half years. It gives more heat on high as the duraflame cabinet heater I purchased for $100.00 this past fall. I should have bought another one of these to heat my larger room.', ""This is a great little heater. It takes the chill out of a room. It is small so it doesn't take up much room and has a safety feature which turns it off when tipped over."", 'i like that the heat comes outof the bottom at floor level . heats the room very fast.so far no problems.like the heat control thermostat.', 'great space heater! - compact, easy on-off switch and setting dial, strong flow, quiet, and best of all, even distribution of soft, warm heat. - very satisfied, AAA+. thank you.', 'Great heaters to heat rooms that you are occupying without breaking your bank account.', 'Using this in bathroom on winter mornings; does not get too hot as some can - safer to use.', 'I just got it yesterday.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

NEW Dr Infrared Heater DR-978 Infrared Space Heater Hybrid Black,75.0, ,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit.

Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.  Am not able to determine if I am saving money on this product or not running it continuously versus other types of heating methods.

Lasko 6405 Space Heater Designer Oscillating Gold,71.01,30-day returns,"[""I previously had one of these heaters and actually heated most of my home with it.  The new one I purchased seems to be just as good so far.  I love the fact that it's beautiful and looks like part of the furniture.  My only complaint is that you can't select a temperature range in low heat.  Selecting a temperature range automatically puts it into high heat."", 'Perfect for 200 to 300 Sq foot area. Nice design. Fits in perfectly with my decor. I really like that you can set the temperature that is comfortable and forget it. It has been perfect for a room that has been a bit chilly in the winter months. Highly recommend 👌 ', ""I love this heater, it heats up a 12x10 room quickly and it's whisper quiet.  I would give it 5 stars but...since it's digital, it only allows you to choose temps in increments of 5 degrees.  70 degrees is just a bit chilly while 75 degrees is a little too warm.  So far though it hasn't gone below freezing out yet, so who knows, it may work out when it's 40 below zero outside."", 'This heater is terrific.  Love the hi and low settings.  Oscillating features is great.  Highly recommend!!', ""I'm glad I bought this heater, just in time for these sub-zero temps. we've been having here in the mid-west.

DuraHeat Electric Heater 1500-Watt 15-Amp Portable Thermostat Steel Yellow,71.4,30-day returns,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time. I put the heater in max mode and not matter what it just wasn't throwing out enough heat.You literally have to be right in front of the heater to feel anything. I wanted something affordable that was not powered by propane however they do say u get what you paid for."", ""I bought two of these for my garage and disregarded the previous reviews i read. The fan barely puts air out. It gets hot, but the fan almost seems like the motor is junk. I'll still use it. I'll just put a box fan behind it so it can actually move heat around."", ""The heater is built well and is safe however its useless in a garage or outdoors. I would recommend it for use in a indoor room or basement environment where it doesn't have to compete with more harsh temperatures. Not exactly what I was hoping for!"", 'This looks good in the pictures, but is a terrible heater. The forced air is a joke. Plus it does not get hot.

DuraHeat Portable Electric Space Heater 1500-Watt with Pivoting Base Yellow,71.42,30-day returns,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time. I put the heater in max mode and not matter what it just wasn't throwing out enough heat.You literally have to be right in front of the heater to feel anything. I wanted something affordable that was not powered by propane however they do say u get what you paid for."", ""I bought two of these for my garage and disregarded the previous reviews i read. The fan barely puts air out. It gets hot, but the fan almost seems like the motor is junk. I'll still use it. I'll just put a box fan behind it so it can actually move heat around."", ""The heater is built well and is safe however its useless in a garage or outdoors. I would recommend it for use in a indoor room or basement environment where it doesn't have to compete with more harsh temperatures. Not exactly what I was hoping for!"", 'This looks good in the pictures, but is a terrible heater. The forced air is a joke. Plus it does not get hot. With the thermostat on high, after 15 minutes, I could still hold my hand about six inches in front of the grill. Very disappointed.', 'I thought I was going to buy this to upgrade the heater I use at work in the shop. I ended up just putting it in my car that I’m working on on the side of my house. It gets to about 80° inside just a car. I don’t expect it would be able to heat the shop.

After checking out just about all of the available products on the market, I spotted the Lasko 5812 heater on Ebay- the ONLY one I could find that directs warm air into the room from the bottom of the unit at floor level.

A bigger than expected fan motor, quiet operation and good performance makes this a 'top pick' portable heater for the price."", ""Best heater on the market, so far. Heat where ever you put it very efficiently to the point, at times, I findmyself turning it down. Have one in my room, and the bathroom, which I let my brother hold for his room, so gonna get another for the bathroom, and one for the kitchen, because we're rarely in the living room. We're able to turn the gas hear off for the entire winter, and use it only to cook and wash clothes, with agas bill of less than $40 a month. The electric is a little higher than normal due to the heater, but nowherenear what utilities would normally cost with the gas included. So yes, this heater does actually save you a lot of money in other areas. And it's extremely sturdy, with a tip over mechanism that works even if the heater is slightly tilted.  Highly recommend.

Mr. Heater 15000 BTU Propane Heater Cooker Portable Camp Hunt Shed Home F242300-,72.92, ,"['I just replaced this unit after my other unit failed after 40 years.  Most products don’t make it 4 years.  I use it ice fishing for warm lunches, in the ice hut for warmth, tent while hunting for a quick morning coffee and in my truck emergency provisions for driving and living in the high Colorado mountains.  As with any propane product, always properly ventilate and don’t fall asleep while in use.', ""Just used it once briefly and seemed to light easily and generate solid radiant heat for a 1lb cylinder heater.  Nice to have the convertible stand for cooking too but haven't tried that and may not."", 'Got this to heat my ice fishing shelter.. It works great and the three settings make it easy to regulated the temperature', ""We bought this heater for our grandson to use in his deer blind. We have several of these and I and my wife set together in a pop-up blind in any weather and have nothing bad to say about this heater. It allows us to cook lunch make coffee and tea which makes for memorable occasion's.I have had issues in the past with this heater and moisture in the propane hose, I use a Mr. Heater in line filter and have eliminated the problem. this is not and isolated issue with this heater as Mr. Heater recommends the inline filter with the big buddy heater which also works to keep moisture out of the propane line."", ""I have been looking for a decent little heater for my hunting blind. The fact that this one only cost me $36. and that it doubles as a cooker compelled me to try it out. I have only tested it at home but it seems to perform as described and I'm confident it will do the job I bought it for. "", 'I like the fact it heats and can also cook on it boils water fast', 'works great. i use a twenty pound bulk tank with hose but ponnd bottles are fine. ', ""Heater/ cooker works well.  Easy and puts out a good amount of heat.  Kinda large if your using for camping, and don't have a lot of packing room.  Being able to use it as a stove is a bonus.   I purchased this one and the one that attached to the larger propane tanks. Both were worth the price."", 'works great just might have to get another', 'This little heater is quick and easy to set up. A small propane canister will give you lots of heat for about 3 hours on high or 4-5hours on low setting. Great buy!!!']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).
