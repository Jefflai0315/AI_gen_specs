"Mr. Heater Buddy Series Hose Assembly - 10-ft., Model# F273704",45.63,141 sold,"[""What I like about this hose: The quality seem very good.&amp; it seals great at both ends. So far I have user about 10x of the 20lb propane tanks through this hose without the (oil trapping) filter and my Mr. Heater - Flex still works as good as when it was brand new. The pilot lights instantly and the burner is ready to turn on within 5 seconds of lighting the pilot. Heater is not showing any signs of being clogged by the oils found the cheaper propane hoses. Per Mr. Heater If you're using a portable propane heater, this IS the hose to get &amp; it pays for itself with the first year. Yes it cost more but you do not need to buy the over priced and sometimes very hard to find disposable filters that Mr. heater recommends replacing every year. Since you payed good money for your heater, why not protect it from clogging by buying this good quality hose. When I bought my Mr Heater, the filters that all the other hoses require were out of stock at  Mr. Heater Lowes, Home Depot &amp; Amazon ect. and where I did find them they were between 2-4 times the normal price = ouch. With the supply chain issues (which could happen again) I didn't want to get stuck needing to use the heater but having to chance using it with a cheaper hose that can clog it with oil (if) I could not get a new filter in the years to come or having to re-use and old contaminated (saturated) filter. I think of this superior quality hose as a good insurance policy for the heater staying reliable for years to come.*What I don't like about it:Just 1 issue, On the package it says that handling it (probably the rubber? part) can expose the person to some gnarly chemicals and to wash the hands immediately after.  Maybe just wear some gloves. It would be nice if Mr. Heater could redesign this hose to have a more user friendly (less toxic) coating on the exterior."", 'Product was as described and a bit cheaper than other places had it listed for. Cant wait to take it camping with us now and run the heater all night with no worry of having to get up in the middle of the night and change little green bottles. ', 'nice sturdy construction, no leaks', ""The hose recommended by MR Heater to use with out buying a filter which I couldn't find. Good to go now Thanks"", 'Great product that works as expected . This is the hose adapter you need so you won’t have to buy a filter.', 'Great product at great price ', 'Just right!', 'Very happy with it.', 'just  what i needed', 'Works good.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

There are only two negatives I have with this hose, but it's still a five star product. The problems are:1) I wish it was longer. Placing the cylinder outside and running the hose through a window limits placement of the heater drastically with only tells feet of length.2) It takes quite a while to get the hose filled with propane to the point where the heater will light. That's to be expected, but that also means a fair amount of gas is lost when disconnecting.Neither of these two problems are really problems per se, just inconveniences.The heater is a really awesome unit. The hose just makes it exponentially better. Buy it."", ""I hooked it up to my LP bottle. You need to push the quick disconnect up until the slide moves up to lock it. It's a little tight but it is a good connection when complete. Bled the air out of the hose with a screwdriver in the quick disconnect. Then hooked it to the heater. It lit up quite quickly. Ran it through all the settings from Pilot, low, medium, to high. Worked very well. Has a nice pliable rubber hose, even in 30° temperature. A little pricey. Otherwise good. "", 'This was delivered a month ago and we have used it daily, until today..The regulator blew a diaphragm inside I guess and was shooting ice cold propane all over the place.  We were not even using it when this happened, luckily or we would have been blown up. Great hose, crappy regulator.  New one is 2 stage and set me back about $30. ', 'The new tank connection, righty tighty, lefty loosey,  is much easier to use.  Nice, well made hose and regulator combo. The quick disconnect end is also handy.', 'Males using Heater much easier', 'Exactly as described fit with no problem', 'Great product a must if u r going to use it alot', 'No Issues.

"Comfort Zone 1,500-Watt Infrared Ceiling Mount Electric Portable Heater Garage",47.21,Last item available,"['I already had one of these so I knew what I was getting.  There was a problem with both units.  The arm that attaches to the sides was installed backwards.  In other words, it was in front of the heating element.  They have about a 90 degree tuning angle.  It had to be taken apart and the base arms rotated 180 degree so the bracket would actually be behind the unit (like the picture shows).  Luckily, I am handy enough to do that.  The units work great but draw a lot of power.  At 1500 watts, a standard house breaker can only handle 2 (if you are lucky) with nothing else turned on. Running 3 units on the 750 watt setting is the best you can ask for.', 'Heater appears to be flimsy and cheaply made. That being said, it seems to work fine. But I have not used it a lot.  Makes me wonder how long it will continue to work.  But for the price, I can not complain. It does its job.  This is a very inexpensive heater.  It is important to have it pointed in the correct direction since it heats surfaces and I am the surface wanting to be heater. I would have liked it better if it could have been angled better, but it seems to have built in tilting restrictions.  The included LED light is cheap, very dim, and close to worthless.  But on the whole I am still happy.  Would I buy it again?  Depends on its longevity. If it lasts more than 3 years, yes.', 'It is well made, the price is a little excessive. It heats well, but only good for a small area. You can mount it several different ways, which is a plus.', ""I have used this type heater in my home shop for the last 15 years and it has done a great job. This past summer I built a 12' X 12' gazebo and I enclosed it for the winter so the kids can use it for a play house and still we cook in there with a electric grill. Since I have used this type heater for several years I decided to buy one for the gazebo and I am glad I did, it does a great job and it was a very good price."", 'Pros, heats well and radiates s good 10 feet plus,  two heat ranges 750 and 1500 watts, pull cord is perfect length for rafter mounting, power cord is long and high quality.    Cons, halogen light is bright and annoying but does not light up any significant space in the room, bracket system is ultra flimsy. Bracket assembly is ratcheted and only goes in one direction. You will break it unless your one in a million that reads bad language Chinese instructions, halogen bulb burns out frequently, are near impossible to find, and cost 8 dollars each. ', 'Really Gets the Heat Out! Ceiling Mount Using the Center Bolt ONLY, and You can Pivot and Swivel, to Aim the Heat at any Spot in a Cold Garage. The Heat Reaches Out 15+ Feet. I would Buy This Heater Again. Well Made, Safe, and Good Value. Highly Recommend.   ', 'Plugged in and all settings work.Chrome area around light is dented from what looks to be the assembly process.Shipping and package Box had no damage I could see.Light weight unit and even on low puts out, really good heat.Not pretty but nice space heater for off the floor unit.', ""I use my heater in my small garage ( 25' x 14' and no insulation) and while we haven't had any bitter cold weather yet, we have had a few nights in the 20 degree range.  My garage stays in the 50 degree range using both lamps."", 'I bought this heater as a supplemental source of heat in my converted step van. It did not maintain adequate heat. If you are looking to add some heat to your garage or workspace, it may be adequate, but as a heating source in a living area it is not sufficient.

"CADET 2F500-1W Electric Baseboard Heater 30"" L 120V White",49.95, ,"[""I was looking for a heater that would go well in our mud room. After looking through a bunch of baseboard heaters, i came across this one. It fits perfectly in the space we have and is very easy to install. It works best with the cadet thermostat which I'm waiting for. (I ordered from two separate sellers) The heater arrived early, and the stat should be here today, per the tracking orders. The stat connects right on the heater, so if you have already installed the 120v wire, you won't need to install low voltage wire to work the baseboard heater. "", ""Price is great, and installation was simple.. Purchased the separate, attached thermostat with OFF mode. Double pole thermostat - yes, works for 110V just fine.  Wiring instructions included with thermostat. Using it to heat a 10'x17' laundry room.  Works very well.  I'm also not one to have it heat to 80 degrees in the winter..  68 to 70 degrees is fine.  Temperatures go down to the upper 30s to 40s."", ""Great Heater's perfect for on demand heat where u have access to electricity.

"Lasko 755320 Ceramic Space Tower Heater, 8.5″L x 7.25″W x 23″H, Silver",48.69, ,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly.

It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit.

Not only that, constantly getting in and out of the car means inevitable snow on one's shoes in bad weather. This is a prescription for cold feet.This product is ideal for the job. Made of rubber so it's impervious to water or stains, cranks out the heat on high and trolls along beautiful on low. Plus, it's good size, bigger than the cheapie models so you don't have to think about where your feet are placed. Great value and highly recommended."", ""This rubber mat is excellent. I use it under my desk to keep my feet warm. It gets very hot. I believe around 135 degrees is what the mat heats up to.

Since it is sturdy for standing on with work shoes it also is tough enough for cats and dogs to sleep on. I put a special wrap on the AC wire to it to prevent animals from damaging the cord and usually use it at the low wattage setting. It is much more sturdy than the electric pet pads that are being sold.', 'My significant other has an office area just outside of our main house, the floor is cold and so were her feet until we put one of these mats under her desk and another by her photo tent.

RoadPro RPSL-681 12V Direct Hook-up Ceramic Heater/Fan with Swivel Base,49.99, ,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge.

"PATTON Electric Utility Heater 1500 WATT Portable PUH680, Tested Heats Fast",50.0,30-day returns,"['Purchased to be able to work in unheated garage during winter.  This item, described as a milk house heater, is smaller and puts out less heat than anticipated.  At its highest setting, I can warm my hands placed right in front of it, which is better than nothing.  On the plus side, the case does not get too hot to touch or to place on work bench, and the unit will shut off if tipped over.  On the downside (for me), while the brand name suggests an American company, the item is actually made in China.', ""I bought two f these heaters to keep my Sailboat warm.  So far they are doing fine. My only complaint is that I wish they came with a way to mount them on a wall.  But so far they are doing the job!  Although they have not had to work to hard so far!   By the way.  If you bag into on and it gets not down.  The heater quickly shuts completely off.  This was a safety feature that was key for my purchase.  Also.  They are made of all medal.  You don't get any residual smile of plastic smiles blowing in your face.  Another espect of this heater that I completely enjoy.  So far they are very durable and if you have a crazy cat name Recon like I do and he flies across the room and knocks the heater over.  The fear of a boat fear is no in the picture... I will say when the fan come on.  You will know it.. They are a little loud.  but run in short spurts!  "", 'The good: it get warmer than my old space heater. I love the fact you can adjust the settings for your comfort level. You will not be disappointed. It had a dial for heat and a separate dial for the fan, which you can set at high, low, or fan only. It also has a built in safety feature if it is moved or falls over for whatever reason, it automatically shuts off. You will not be disappointed.The bad: Nothing', 'I had two for the last 5 or so years, one finally broke so i replaced it with the same product', ""Replaced a previous version of the same heater. This one seems to have some design improvements that may make it last longer. On previous heaters, the heating elements broke, but this one has an added cable threaded through the element. I'm happy to see that the new one has a separate fan only setting."", 'Good little heater, fairly sturdy. I like the handles especially because you can hang it it, carry it easily, move it around easily. It can keep a mid size room pretty warm, I was impressed. My only dislike is that its a little loud...but I bought 2 and the other one is not as loud so Im not sure my dislike is fully warranted but for the one I have its a bit to loud. Overall great value', 'Really works well - solid - cranks out the heat. I own several of these and they are tough as nails - have had them for years. Best space heater for the money!', 'I went for this because of the picture and it showed that the guards goes all the way down the vent exit and it does not. it seems like it is struggling by the amount of time it takes to shut off the hotter you put it. it could be by design as well but it does heat very well. and the speed of the delivery made me increase the stars', 'The power switch is frozen on hi after just 2 weeks from receiving it. Fire hazard if you ask me.', ""I love this heater!!! It's small enough and quite enough to use in the family room.

Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681),49.88,30-day returns,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.

"Lasko 1500W Ceramic Space Heater with Timer and Thermostat, CC13700, Black",49.83, ,"['My Lasko CC13700 was manufactured Feb 2019 Purchased 11/11/19 from a local store. This was made in China where forced labor is documented but Lasko’s Social Responsibility statement addresses that issue: “Lasko and its affiliates will not work with any suppliers that engage in human trafficking and/or slavery.” The CC13700 seemed like it had an unusually strong odor new out of the box while it was heating. The heat was great but using it with the odor in the living area brought some unpleasant upper respiratory irritation and potential health issues that go along with that. After it aired out during the first year, the odor was not as noticeable in a well-ventilated area. At the end of the second season, it began to shut off immediately after turning on. It was under warranty so I sent an email to customer service and got a helpful reply the same evening. The suggestion of blowing air into the unit from the outside was a temporary fix for a few months but the heater eventually stopped blowing heat again so I submitted a warranty request. Due to the Lasko heater breakdown, I bought a new baseboard-style heater (without the chemical odor) before getting the replacement. Lasko Consumer Services stood behind the 3 year warranty. CC13700 was on back order and not available so they offered a different model. I did not have to pay return shipping and received a replacement fan heater within 15 days. It’s great to have to have a new Lasko fan heater, but it reintroduces the same indoor air pollution so I’m using this one away from the bedroom and main living areas to give it a year to air out. Regarding the CC13700 magnetic field, I checked it with a Triaxial ELF Magnetic Field Meter and found that the magnetic field from the motor was almost 48” in all directions, so I kept that in mind to maintain some distance while the heater was in use. The closed design with easy-vacuum filter is a nice innovation compared with open design fan heaters. Weekly filter vacuuming was essential to keep the plastic case cool and AC plug prongs from getting too hot in the outlet. I wish I could give the CC13700 more than 2 stars because it was excellent at putting out heat but apparently it wasn’t built to last. I think a heater should work for 5 years to earn a 5 star rating but this stopped working in less than 2 years. Fortunately there was a 3 year warranty and Lasko handled the warranty replacement very well (but the replacement heater deserves separate review because it is a different product and model number.) If the CC13700 could be repaired and used again, I would be open to editing the review with a higher rating because it was great before it stopped working. This was powerful and it produced instant hot air: I set Automatic Temperature Control about 15 degrees lower than expected to get the desired level of heat. (CC13700 digital temperature at the floor reads lower than other thermometers that I have and since heat rises, it might take several hours to raise floor temperature one degree in a small room, even with the door shut, while temperature 5 feet above the heater may be 10-20 degrees higher than what is shown on the display.) At first I didn’t like the CC13700 because it has an ergonomic design flaw that took awhile to get used to, in which placing the fingers under the carry handle makes it feel like it might be easy to tip over or drop. Regarding the digital controls: Pressing the red On button starts the heater on Hi setting. The 2 left buttons activate Automatic Temperature Control with digital setting range from 39F-90F (which must be set with the heater turned on and running). After selecting temperature, the DIGITAL DISPLAY FLASHES SEVERAL TIMES. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DO ANYTHING ELSE AT THAT POINT. Wait for the display to return to indicate the current room temperature and the Automatic Temperature Control should be set.  Automatic Temperature Control seems to have 3 degree temperature window which raises the temperature 2 degrees above the thermostat setting and drops one degree below before resuming operation. AC power interruption resets digital features to factory default. Pressing the middle timer button reveals 9 settings to set the timer between 1-8 hours or continuous. Adjustable louver control for directional heat is a nice feature made possible by the closed design.', 'Ordered 2 heaters,Wanted to send them back because they were way  to small,but I deceived to try them and boy do they heat up,I got so worm I had to kick off the blankets in the middle of the night.For such a small heater they generate a lot of heat.', 'High temp trips my 20 amp breaker. works fine on low', 'heat my bathroom very well love it', 'This product heats the interior of a 36 foot Avion 5th wheel RV when the outside temperature is &gt;30 degrees F.

Presto Heat Dish Parabolic Electric Heater Home Office Heater 1000 Watt 120 Volt,49.0, ,"[""I use this heater in my clinic and my patients absolutely love it. It's amazing how quickly it heats a room without air blasting or noise. It has a nice safety feature where it makes a horrible noise if it's tipping over (it only happens if I'm moving it when it's on). In fact several of my patients have gone out and bought their own for home. I should get a commission."", 'I have an old 1911 craftsman style house with no insulation.  My heating system is an outdated oil furnace.  As we all know the price of fuel is always fluctuating and seems like it is going to stay that way.  It costs me about $300.00 a month in the winter.  Which is ridiculous, especially when the heat just does not stay in the house for long.I needed a knew plan and changing out the heat system or insulating the house is not an option at this time.  So I went out and bought the presto heatdish.  It produces so much heat that during the winter I no longer had to heat the entire house to stay warm.  I would just carry the heatdish around with me, saving me hundreds of dollars month to month.  I had a few other electric heaters before I purchased this one and the difference is night and day.I  have had this heater for almost 3 years now and it still works as well as the day I purchased it.  It paid for itself in its first week work.  With as much use as this gets I would of expected it to burn out a while ago, but that is not the case.The drawbacks: It does not have an automatic turn off system if it were to fall over, but it does have an alarm that is unmistakably loud.   There is also a footlight that you cannot turn off or on, but you can just take out the lightbulb if that bothers you.Great product and highly recommended. Thanks for reading.', ""Proven, ancient technology that outperforms the daylights of newer, highly rated products. It's effective (heats the room quickly and thoroughly), efficient (only 1,000 watts), safe (automatic shut-off features), and built to last. Sometimes a product cannot be improved upon.  "", 'It gives off a good amount of heat but it has one big design flaw where the dish can not be tilted. This means the dish is in a fixed position which points into the air slightly. So if the surface you place it on is taller than you are while seated you will struggle to feel it. The safety tip over buzzer also prevents you from sliding something underneath it to tilt it yourself.', ""This is a wonderful heater.  I am a smoker and visit my family a lot.  I choose to smoke in the garage there and my sister in law bought this for me to use in the garage. It warms up quickly for the immediate area and it doesn't take long for the surrounding areas to warm up either. Once this gets going I don't even need a coat.  (Ohio area)  I have a house with very tall ceilings in the master bedroom and living area.  In the winter this little heater warms up quickly, even going right to the high setting.  I always have to turn it way back too.  I am widowed now and I don't need to keep the entire house warm, just where I am.  I do recommend this.  Oh, it is safe, if you move it at all when it is on you get a loud buzz sound!  If on the fence about it I would go with it."", 'Great price, lightweight, energy efficient. It has worked very well so far. The price was the best I found on Ebay. I think the design is very good. The shape of the dish plus the shiny interior helps it be much more efficient than a regular space heater. It gets very hot very fast. It also has a buzzer in case it tips over. A great all around heater to warm a person up fast.', ""These are fabulous heaters (radiant warmth, like the sun) and are in great condition.At first they didn't quite meet my needs, because I needed them to point straight ahead, whereas they are angled slightly upward and this is not adjustable. However, I set each heater on a slanted platform (which I made out of heavy cardboard), and now they meet my needs perfectly. (Parabolic heat dish heaters warm whatever is directly in front of them, within about, say, 15 feet.) You won't believe how much glowing warmth they put out!Also, Rob was great to do business with."", ""I live in a 1920's craftsman style house with poor insulation. This heater is wonderful and has allowed me to turn my thermostat down several degrees and still be comfortable here in Minnesota. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could because it is actually a little bit large to walk around in a small house with small rooms.  But that said, even set as low as it will go, it still puts out a lot of heat. In fact, I have to be careful not to put it in a room near my thermostat because the furnace will not come on at all if I do!  I have already recommended it to friends."", 'This heat dish pumps out heat so intensely it’s like a dryer for your cloths if sitting in front of it. I could feel it’s radiant heat from about 15ft away. Wayyyy better than other heat dish I had no contest. It does not oscillate and no remote only 2 features not on this probably because it is heavy duty. This is the best heat dish, look no further. ', ""I had a socially distanced bourbon tasting party for four on my back patio during January 2021 in Chicago. My neighbor had two of the Presto dishes so I ordered two more. Even though the evening's temperature dipped into the mid-20s, all four of us were completely comfortable sitting in our patio chairs with a our own Presto dish to keep us warm. The next day I ordered two more dishes to complete my set.""]","Used: An item that has been used previously.

I\'m using it in a 12x12 office, and it is more than adequate to the task.  So far I\'ve used it on the first (lower power) setting at about a ""4"" heat setting (about 1/3 of max).

Fan isn't overly loud and puts out a good amount of heat at the low setting.  I rarely use it at the high setting until it starts getting older.  I have gone thru 2 of these units in a 10 to 11 year period.  My 2nd one (about 5 years old) is starting to waiver.

The cord is 16 AWG with 105C rating, which appears adequately sized.  Although I did not test them for very long, the heaters and fan did turn off when the temperature setting was reduced to a very low level.

I did not test if the overheating reset would ever turn them off.', 'This heater did a nice job of heating my area at work.  I sit near an outside wall that is very cold some days.

Lasko is a decent brand, not high end but should last 2-3 years....or more but for for 20.00 what would you expect. Dials are easy and built in temperature regulator is a must. I love mine and think it's a great value. I once ran a lasko fan straight 24 hrs - 7 days a week for 2 years without any issue. It started to rust from the moisture in the area or it would probably still be running. Good purchase and I am very pleased."", ""I think a lot of space heaters between 20-40$ are all the similar, they all break or are just as good as broken by the end of the season. This space heater seems of much better quality, even the material seems of high quality, instead of plastic like most. I also like that it's small and wisper quite. I have no complaints.

Lasko is a decent brand, not high end but should last 2-3 years....or more but for for 20.00 what would you expect. Dials are easy and built in temperature regulator is a must. I love mine and think it's a great value. I once ran a lasko fan straight 24 hrs - 7 days a week for 2 years without any issue. It started to rust from the moisture in the area or it would probably still be running. Good purchase and I am very pleased."", ""I think a lot of space heaters between 20-40$ are all the similar, they all break or are just as good as broken by the end of the season. This space heater seems of much better quality, even the material seems of high quality, instead of plastic like most. I also like that it's small and wisper quite. I have no complaints. I got it for 20$ which was a fantastic deal but I would have paid 35$ or even more for a heater with this quality. My biggest pro is the size.

Cozy Products Cozy Legs 200-Watt Electric Heater Black (CL-2) ,48.4,30-day returns,"['I bought this to keep my dog warm in her Dogglue.   Most heated dog mats look and feel flimsy...hardly the type of thing that will survive daily use.  In addition few are water proof.  I put this under a rug and my dog loves it.  Top of rug just warm.   It is on its second winter of use now and seems just like new.', 'This will not keep your legs warm. Poorly engineered so it is annoying to move around, even slightly. Needs twice the wattage to be of any use whatsoever. Mine arrived so poorly packaged that the box was opened on one end and the fixtures were strewn around my front door. That is a packaging, not a shipping problem.', 'This unit may be good for a small enclosed area such as under a desk. It has no value what so ever for any other purpose, as far as I can tell.  The surface gets very warm but no heat is felt further that about 5"" away.The claim that it uses 1/10 the power of regular space heaters is true.  On the other hand it gives off about 1/20 of the heat.Just be aware, before you buy, that it is not a space heater. If your legs were under a small desk or in a box, it may have some value. I would not recommend it for ANY other application or anything for that matter!  Forget about it.', ""This doesn't put out fabulous amounts of heat.  It does work to keep my feet warm, but the effect is extremely subtle.  One minor niggle is that the power switch is several feet down the power cord from the unit.  It would be more convenient if the power switch was ON the unit.  I would buy this unit again."", 'I bought this vertical leg heater for my wife who spends a lot of time on a laptop. It is positioned under a bench type seat and heats from behind her legs. This removes the chill from her legs and feet quickly. This radiant heat is much better and safer than a space heater in my opinion.', 'I put one between an outside wall and my home-made desk, which is open-sided. After it warmed up the difference was noticeable. The space under the desk gets quite cozy, especially on the side that used to be coldest.. This is much better than using a free-standing heater that can be kicked over.', 'it was junk , had to return it.', ""They barely warm up.

We Warm Quartz Infrared Heater 1500 Watts Large Remote Control HT1013US,48.0, ,"['This heater was bought to heat a 12x14 room and it works perfect.  it keeps the room warm and comfortable.  I have been very pleased with the performance and would recommend it.  also i feel it is safe for kids to be around it. ', ""I haven't had my two heaters very long but I can tell you they work really really well., They have a pretty good fan that blows the heat a good distance for a heater that size. Well worth the money!!"", 'I love it 1 heats my 29ft Travel Trailer and 2 of them heat my 34ft 5th Wheel...I really appreciate your product.January 2019, the beginning of the month we had an issue with the fan in one of the Heaters and the other one started making the same noise.  I called the company and they were great with me. I really felt good about the company. I sent them both back as a set and with no hassle they sent me another set. I had the choice of the money or another sent. I picked another sett because they work exolent, no issues and like I said it heats my 29ft Travel Trailer. The other one was put in our 34ft 5th Wheel and It worked great also. I am very happy about these heaters...Thank you so much for standing behind your words. It is very well appreciated by us.', 'These heaters work pretty well. I use them in my garage to keep it warm when I’m working . Only drawback is that they will kick your GFI every so often. I’m not sure if they over draw current ? But I’ve had to reset my breaker several times after I was left in the dark garage after they blew my breaker. Nice thermostat that’s pretty accurate, nice quick heat up, blower fairly strong. They are not near as good as a 220Volt or gas heater. But for the price you get 2. At retailers you pay this  price for 1. All in all a strong 8.5/10. I don’t use it everyday so I’m sure it will last.', 'I live in a block house and it is cold in the winter time and  expensive to keep warm. This heater does a really good job keeping a large room warm.  I get daily reports on how much electricity I use each day from the electric company and my daily Kilowatt usage did not go up that much when I started using the heater. I think this heater is a very good choice. I plan to purchase another one for  my closed in porch area. I am a cold natured person and I recommend this heater.', 'Small in size.....good and bad. Not so sure about large room claim. Would probably run constantly. Recommendation more positive than negative......but not by much.', 'Furnace in a box. We were having some issues with our furnace &amp; this item was the deal of the day. not wanting to have frozen pipes, I ordered one. Very easy to use and effective for even a large room or basement. If you are lazy, the remote is a plus. looks good and preforms the task. Nice product at a super price.', ""Just got it today, It really does not put out very much heat in my very small office,very disappointed with this product. It has a remote and buttons on the front of the unit, seems like it has no effect on it whatsoever. My office is 6'X15 and it is 39 degrees here and it is not real warm in here now."", ""I have a very large open living room and kitchen, probably 1200 sq ft together and 2 of these heat do a pretty good job of keeping it warm.  I have my main house heater set of 62 and these 2 heater set to 67.  They kick on and off as they should and keep the main house heater usage down.  Probably work really good if I had 3 of these for this space.

Lasko 1500W Electric Portable Ceramic Tower Heater Remote Control Oscillation,45.0, ,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater. And If I have to replace any one of the heaters I have, it will be with a Lasko 5572 heater.HJ of Missouri', ""We were absolutely thrilled with the size and capability of this room heater.  It's a little taller than the other Lasko portable heater and our decision to get it was a good one. For our needs, this one is perfect. "", 'I really enjoy my heater.  I live in Arizona where it is getting cooler at night now.  It is very efficient and quiet.', 'Heats small area immediately in the morning, with an increase of 5-10 degrees in temperature within 15 minutes.  Easy to operate, with remote.  As usual: follow directions in the manufacturers manual for best results!', ""Wow, does this put out some heat, and like now..  Don't have to wait for anything to warm up  immediate heat..  2 modes low 900w and high 1500w..  Plus you can set it from 39 degrees to 90 degrees and to kick on automatically if room gets below set temp..  This can almost heat my whole house..  Will prob heat at least 3 rooms.Led readouts are bright and clear, fan, remote, oscillates, has real buttons, not plastic film that will wear out, and stands tall.  Has handle for easy moving.. With gas prices doubling this winter, I'm turning to a space heater so I can lower the thermostat.. "", 'great heater, used it all winter, no problems, good price, fast delivery', ""I don't have this exact model, but I have two similar Lesco 1500w heaters w/digital displays w/remotes.  I bought the second one because one of our tenants lost the remote.  One is #5165, the other one is #755320, the only complaint I have on this model is I had to stick a piece of foam tale on the top of the carrying slot in back so my finger wouldn't slip out of the carrying slot when carrying the heater.  The other heater's slot is angled so your fingers don't slip out.  The one remote does control either heater.  I recommended my satisfaction to a friend and he bought one and is happy with it.  I don't know his model #. I've had the first hater 5 yrs and the second one 2 yrs and both work great."", ""Great heater. Warms my garage better than expected.
