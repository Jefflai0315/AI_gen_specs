One burner shut off a couple times...but did finally stay on the last time I lit it.The final reason why I decided to by the Mr. Heater is because the statement said it was made in the USA.  Not so!!!  When I received it, I looked on the box and it said (MADE IN CHINA).Disappointing.  I, personally, am REALLY tired of buying stuff made in China!!!  If there was a neutral button, I would have gone all neutral.BUY USA....  Thank you, Tom', ""Pro's~~puts out a lot of heat fast.  I haven't  used it enough to rate its fuel consumption efficiency.

These are visible in the pictures shown.  Maybe perfectly safe, just look iffy."", 'I have one other Mr. Heater product and it works fine so I purchased this unit. The unit goes out constantly whenever a slight breeze is blowing. It is extremely frustrating having to constantly be watching the outages. I contacted customer service at Mr. Heater to explain the issue and got only one argument after another. The representative was more interested in arguing semantics like wind vs. breeze rather than addressing the issue at hand. I was totally frustrated and am totally dissatisfied with this product. I would absolutely NOT recommend this product to anyone who is planning on using it outdoors for any reason. This is an ongoing issue as I have since read several reviews from others who have the same problem with this product.

Broan 157 Aluminum NuTone Low-Profile Fan-Forced Ceiling Heater 120Vac,119.00,44 sold,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation. The power to the heater tested good.', ""Love this little heater, just renivating my Mum's home.   It's so nice to have this little heater in the basement bath.  Very reasonable in price and a nice touch!!!"", 'Brand new unused, unopened.  Excellent purchase. ', 'The Broan 157 ceiling heater is a great upgrade from the "" twisted wire element "" heater.

Mr. Heater MH9BX Portable Propane Heater - Red New,119.96,5 watchers,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‚Äò88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don‚Äôt get me wrong.

It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived.

Mr Heater - Big Buddy Portable Propane Heater - Includes Hose and filter,115.0, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.

I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill.

It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don‚Äôt aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.

DeLonghi HMP1500 Mica Panel Heater,119.0, ,"[""I like this heater a lot. I bought two of them. One I've mounted on my bedroom wall. The other I left on its wheels so I can move it around the house. And it does have a very comfortable recessed carrying handle. It does give off an offensive odor at the beginning, so I recommend placing it outside, running, for 3-4 hours and that should burn off the smell. It's very, very quiet but not totally silent. I has a slight audible hum, which I thought would bother me at first, but I've easily adjusted to it. In fact, I learned to find it comforting, like white noise. I find listening to its slight hum and feeling its warming comfort actually induces me to go to sleep. It's a radiant heater, but unlike the older type radiant heaters, it doesn't cook you. It has two settings. On Minimum (800 watts), only the top one third of the heater heats up. On Max (1500 watts), the entire heater heats up. It can heat up my 10' by 10' bedroom on a very cold day (around 32 degrees) within in an hour.  The only fault that I've found with this heater is that the automatic shut off alarm can kick in too soon, before the it's completed its job, but that happens only on Max. Otherwise, once I warm up my bedroom, I can run it on Minimum all night with no disturbing alarm. I've put it on a remote controlled timer switch that can be set to shut off at intervals of 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, or longer. I do this to save electricity. Just be sure the timer you buy can handle more than 1500 watts. At the same time, it's also plugged into a remote controlled thermostat (available on eBay). I set the heater's thermostat to its highest setting, and let the remote thermostat control when the heater comes on and off."", 'warms quickly, feels healthy, large surface heat area. best heater so far. thanks', ""I came to the conclusion that this heater would be a good pick for a bedroom.

Portable Buddy Heater - Massachusetts and Canada Version F232050,115.28,30-day returns,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions.

I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater.

Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Lasko 758000 Cyclonic Ceramic Heater - Ceramic - Electric,115.32,30-day returns,"['The Lasko Cyclonic ceramic Heater is a great choice to heat a room.  Why?  well, here is what I think about my new heater.First, i was looking for a heater to use in my 160 Sq ft shop, that didn\'t take up a whole bunch of space. The Lasko heater is a good compact size, unlike Baseboard heaters that take up three to five or more feet of wall space, where you can\'t put things in front of them, this heater is only about 17"" wide.  Or my former oil radiator heater, that works well, but I had to pull it out from the wall to use it, as it gets hot all around it.This heater will heat a larger room, but I chose it because I wanted a fairly fast warm up, when I start to work.  I chose Electric because I don\'t want fumes or have to worry about getting Propane, or Kerosene.  I like the feel of the Electric heat.This heater has a thermostat that can be set, and a timer if you want it to go off by itself. Very Convenient !  It draws the cool air from the floor, and blows warm air out the top, from it\'s moveable ( up and down) exhaust.  The Fan forced air can travel most of the way across the room, which helps circulate the warmth evenly.The heater fan has two speeds so it\'s quiet enough to use in a bedroom if you want, and can be put right up against the wall so it\'s out of the way.I have used this in my shop for several days now, some as cold as 25 degrees outside, and this Lasko heater warms the shop up to a comfortable (for me) 68 deg. in about 30 minutes.Because it\'s only 25"" tall, the temperature the display on the front says, may need to be adjusted to your own likings, but I\'ve found once the whole room has warmed up the temp. displayed is within 2 degrees of the Thermometer I have on the other end of the room.So it does keep up with the set temperature when in thermostat mode fairly well. You can just have it on low heat or high heat all the time, but I like the convenience of the thermostat mode. It\'s simple to operate, and comes in several colors, to match your decor. While the housing is mostly Plastic, the Heater is sturdy enough. Because it is only 6.5"" deep, it stays tucked up tight ot the wall out of my way, and doesn\'t heat up the wall, like my oil/electric radiator did, but fear not if you tip it over, it has automatic shutoff.I don\'t have any complaints about this heater. I think it\'s just about perfect for small shops like mine, or a cold bedroom , or even to heat larger areas. Lasko made a good all around Electric heater here.', ""i've been using these for 7yrs now, after 4yrs took apart and cleaned them (i have 5) and even the 7yr old works as it did when new, i dont like to waste money so i have stuck with this model, i have the electronic version also (black)at another location, they are okay but not built the same inside, these seem to be better built, they do what they are designed to do, and i always use the ceiling fan to bring the heat down and mix it up so they dont run forever. i run 1 in each bedroom and two in the living room, not too loud, i know they are not a furnace, temperature at the grill is abt 200 degrees coming out so i use the ceiling fans on low or medium to help mix it up otherwise all the heat stays up at the ceiling. I feel this is the best heater in this class."", 'Nice heater that does a great job. Already own 6. Is an inexpensive way to heat house and safer as well. Does not impact the electric bill hardly any at all. Do not have to worry about tipping over, has solid stand. I use to use gas as a means of heating my two story house until I found this type of heater. I have purchased four or five other heaters of this type for relatives and friends.', ""bought two of them in the past 2 years and both of them were defective. I have one that is 10 to 15 years old and still works. that's why i wanted one the same brand. MUST NOT BE TESTING THEM !!!"", 'Unstable. No tip over feature. Never stopped outgassing plastic smell.', 'Borrowed a lasko heater last year coverage was great economical and safe so bought the same model very happy with it!', 'This heater works safely when it is sitting against the wall. To adjust to any temperature is very easy. It also shows the actual temperature in the area.', 'I purchased this heater, to use in my RV.  It is quite efficient.  Enjoying the efficiency and temperature control.  ', ""I now own three (3) of 'em... The oldest one is starting its 5th winter.  "", ""OUR LIVING ROOM IS BIG AND WE KEEP THE THERMOSTAT DOWN TO 68 WE NEEDED AN EXTRA HEATER TO HELP KEEP IT WARMER. WE DO NOT LIKE IT HOT TO SLEEP SO WE TRIED THIS. REALLY LIKE IT CAN STAND IT AGAINST THE WALL AND NO WORRIES. THE AIR IS DRAWN IN THE BOTTOM AND COMES OUT THE TOP NICE AND WARM.THE ONLY CHANGE I WOULD MAKE IS FOR THE AIR TO BE DRAWN IN THE TOP AND COME OUT THE BOTTOM NICE AND WARM,DUE TO COLD FLOORS. TRIED TO FIND ONE BUT DIDN'T. ANYHOW, THIS HEATER IS VERY GOOD.EASY TO MOVE.

"157 Ceiling Mount Heater, Fan Forced, 1250W, 120V, 10.42A, 4,266-BTUs - Quantity",119.0, ,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation. The power to the heater tested good.', ""Love this little heater, just renivating my Mum's home.   It's so nice to have this little heater in the basement bath.  Very reasonable in price and a nice touch!!!"", 'Brand new unused, unopened.  Excellent purchase. ', 'The Broan 157 ceiling heater is a great upgrade from the "" twisted wire element "" heater. This unit has a solid element like on a stove top burner and heats my bathroom better.  You will be very happy with this unit.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Vornado EH1-0020-25 5118 BTU 120V Vortex Electric Thermostat Heater,117.11,30-day returns,"[""I already own multiple Vornado products including a VH103 I purchased in 2011 that I'm still using to this day.What I liked the most is that it uses mechanical (not electronic) switches. You have 3 rocker switches with a main power switch, heat low/high setting and fan setting). You also have a dial to enable fan only mode (to use year round) or auto. You can use this with a remote or smart outlet (15A rating).What I don't like- somewhat hard to clean. In my experience, cleaning is not for the faint of heart. It is built exactly like the VH103 such that you have to unscrew the unit completely to separate the front and back, then I used a shopvac to blow out the dust from the heating coils and a cloth to wipe down the fan blade and clean out the grille. I've done this about every 3 years.Most critical difference between this VH2 and the older VH103:- When in heat mode, the fan in the VH2 will cycle on/off when in auto when the temperature is reached. In the VH103, the fan will continue running to maintain airflow and circulation- The temperature dial on the VH2 goes from 1-7 while the VH103 goes from approx 65 - 90 degrees. I found it much easier to dial in my setting when I could set it against a temperature. With the VH2, you need to figure out what dial setting works for you."", 'This heater warms up my room quickly and the thermostat feature works well to maintain desired temperature. Fan is a little noisy, but not horrible. I love that I can run the fan without heat to circulate air in my home especially when running an air purifier. Cream color fits well with my plaster walls. Auto-shutoff for tippage actually works! Would buy again, would recommend. ', ""Pros:- Fast and efficient with small rooms. This heats up a small room within 15 minutes on high (1500W) at setting 4. Once warm, it can be switched to low (750W) and turned down by 1 to maintain temperature.- Small. Doesn't take a lot of space and is easy to move around.Cons:- Noisy. Makes a notable but tolerable hum when operating.- Cannot set a temperature. Numbers are for adjusting the run time, but you must experiment. Set it too low and the room will cool faster than it gets heated.- Weak fan. Perfect for heating, but not for cooling a room during summer."", 'This is a great little portable heater for small spaces.I use it to heat a single room in the winter time vs heating up the wholehouse to warm up that room. Its relatively quiet and puts out a decent amountof heat vs several other portable heaters I tried out. I have only purchased them used due to the price of a new one buthave been quite pleased with its performance.', ""I purchased this heater to heat a bedroom but when I saw how much power it had, I used it to heat my whole loft. I am surprised that such a little unit could produce so much heat and I don't even have it on high. I'm very satisfied with this little heater and would definitely recommend it for small to large being needs."", 'I have tried a number of electric heaters to warm my finished basement.  Most of them do not last long or do not distribute the heat evenly.  So far this heater does a nice job and takes up very little room.  Time will tell if it can do the job over a long period, but so far so good.', ""I've been using this heater to keep my enclosed porch warm, we only have storm windows (ten of them) and they are not air tight as good windows would be.  This heater kept the porch around 58 degrees when the overnight temperature got down to twenty seven on a stormy windy night.  The heat is comfortable and even and the heater runs very quiet and is a stable unit.  I've been running it with the setting about half and on low almost continuously except if it warms up outside in the daytime then I turn it off.  The housing of the unit is also staying cool and I have cats on the porch who seem very happy with it and that's good enough for me.  However, haven't received my latest electric bill since I've been using it and I do expect it to go up, I'm just hoping it won't be too much."", 'A heater with a fan, what an idea ! ! !  Vornado makes terrific fan. Most space heaters make heat and if you sit over it you can get some heat from it. With the fan in this heater, this Whole Room Heater can raise the comfort level in a room by 20 degrees through out the room. Get it, you will LOVE it ! ! !', 'This heater definitely works better than other portable heaters I‚Äôve used, but it smells like it‚Äôs burning. That said, it is cool to the touch, so it seems safe enough, just stinks. It warms my room about 5 degrees more than other space heaters I‚Äôve tried, and I‚Äôve tried several.', 'Love it! Arrived promptly, is like new. We have used these heaters before and they are great.  Also can be used as fan only to move cool air. Using it in RV right now.  Sure saves a lot of propane as supplement to central heat unit.  Great seller!  We loaned one of these to a neighbor in an RV park at Grand Canyon a few years ago, whose heating system went out in a remote area.  They said it saved their lives.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Radiant Propane Space Heater Compact Fold Down Handle Outdoor 9000 BTU 225 Sq Ft,116.99, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‚Äò88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Electric Ceramic Space Heater Portable Oscillating 1500 W Digital Display Timer,115.54, ,"['The Lasko Cyclonic ceramic Heater is a great choice to heat a room.  Why?  well, here is what I think about my new heater.First, i was looking for a heater to use in my 160 Sq ft shop, that didn\'t take up a whole bunch of space. The Lasko heater is a good compact size, unlike Baseboard heaters that take up three to five or more feet of wall space, where you can\'t put things in front of them, this heater is only about 17"" wide.  Or my former oil radiator heater, that works well, but I had to pull it out from the wall to use it, as it gets hot all around it.This heater will heat a larger room, but I chose it because I wanted a fairly fast warm up, when I start to work.  I chose Electric because I don\'t want fumes or have to worry about getting Propane, or Kerosene.  I like the feel of the Electric heat.This heater has a thermostat that can be set, and a timer if you want it to go off by itself. Very Convenient !  It draws the cool air from the floor, and blows warm air out the top, from it\'s moveable ( up and down) exhaust.  The Fan forced air can travel most of the way across the room, which helps circulate the warmth evenly.The heater fan has two speeds so it\'s quiet enough to use in a bedroom if you want, and can be put right up against the wall so it\'s out of the way.I have used this in my shop for several days now, some as cold as 25 degrees outside, and this Lasko heater warms the shop up to a comfortable (for me) 68 deg. in about 30 minutes.Because it\'s only 25"" tall, the temperature the display on the front says, may need to be adjusted to your own likings, but I\'ve found once the whole room has warmed up the temp. displayed is within 2 degrees of the Thermometer I have on the other end of the room.So it does keep up with the set temperature when in thermostat mode fairly well. You can just have it on low heat or high heat all the time, but I like the convenience of the thermostat mode. It\'s simple to operate, and comes in several colors, to match your decor. While the housing is mostly Plastic, the Heater is sturdy enough. Because it is only 6.5"" deep, it stays tucked up tight ot the wall out of my way, and doesn\'t heat up the wall, like my oil/electric radiator did, but fear not if you tip it over, it has automatic shutoff.I don\'t have any complaints about this heater. I think it\'s just about perfect for small shops like mine, or a cold bedroom , or even to heat larger areas. Lasko made a good all around Electric heater here.', ""i've been using these for 7yrs now, after 4yrs took apart and cleaned them (i have 5) and even the 7yr old works as it did when new, i dont like to waste money so i have stuck with this model, i have the electronic version also (black)at another location, they are okay but not built the same inside, these seem to be better built, they do what they are designed to do, and i always use the ceiling fan to bring the heat down and mix it up so they dont run forever. i run 1 in each bedroom and two in the living room, not too loud, i know they are not a furnace, temperature at the grill is abt 200 degrees coming out so i use the ceiling fans on low or medium to help mix it up otherwise all the heat stays up at the ceiling. I feel this is the best heater in this class."", 'Nice heater that does a great job. Already own 6. Is an inexpensive way to heat house and safer as well. Does not impact the electric bill hardly any at all. Do not have to worry about tipping over, has solid stand. I use to use gas as a means of heating my two story house until I found this type of heater. I have purchased four or five other heaters of this type for relatives and friends.', ""bought two of them in the past 2 years and both of them were defective. I have one that is 10 to 15 years old and still works. that's why i wanted one the same brand. MUST NOT BE TESTING THEM !!!"", 'Unstable. No tip over feature. Never stopped outgassing plastic smell.', 'Borrowed a lasko heater last year coverage was great economical and safe so bought the same model very happy with it!', 'This heater works safely when it is sitting against the wall. To adjust to any temperature is very easy. It also shows the actual temperature in the area.', 'I purchased this heater, to use in my RV.  It is quite efficient.  Enjoying the efficiency and temperature control.  ', ""I now own three (3) of 'em... The oldest one is starting its 5th winter.  "", ""OUR LIVING ROOM IS BIG AND WE KEEP THE THERMOSTAT DOWN TO 68 WE NEEDED AN EXTRA HEATER TO HELP KEEP IT WARMER. WE DO NOT LIKE IT HOT TO SLEEP SO WE TRIED THIS. REALLY LIKE IT CAN STAND IT AGAINST THE WALL AND NO WORRIES. THE AIR IS DRAWN IN THE BOTTOM AND COMES OUT THE TOP NICE AND WARM.THE ONLY CHANGE I WOULD MAKE IS FOR THE AIR TO BE DRAWN IN THE TOP AND COME OUT THE BOTTOM NICE AND WARM,DUE TO COLD FLOORS. TRIED TO FIND ONE BUT DIDN'T. ANYHOW, THIS HEATER IS VERY GOOD.EASY TO MOVE.

My wife dragged me to Lowe's to by a heater. I told her that we should buy a ceramic heater instead of a infrared heater. But like always she didn't want to listen.

Right now we are having the coldest below zero weather in years and it is still keeping things at around 60 with no other heater. needless to say, we have turned on an additional ceramic heater and the temp in the living room isaround 65. I repeat we have no other furnace or heater in the housethe basement stays around 60 all the time but as soon as the outdoors temps rise into the 20's and 30's it will be about 68 in here and we will only need the large Lasco heater.I am very happy with this heater."", 'Works well and looks like the picture, but not quite the remote I was looking for.

Mr. Heater Golf Cart Heater Portable ATV UTV BUGGIES Camp Hunt Garage F242010.,119.92, ,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

Super quiet! I am using it in what was a screened-in lanai (remodeled into a 4-season sunroom). With all these windows it gets chilly in here at times, even though the room has central heat. This Lasko heater is just the thing to take the chill out of the room. I can't speak to its longevity, as I have only had it a few weeks, but it seems very well made."", 'My only reservation is it is a little on the large side, but it is working great so far.', 'Unit works well.No complaints.Have owned for 2 yearsComes in handy when the furnace sometimes breaks down. Or to take the chill off a basement bedroom.I Would buy again.But remember, it‚Äôs electric and the electric meter spins like a top', 'It works great and is silent other than the chirping to let you know the temp is increasing. I need another one. I highly recommend it.', 'I didn‚Äôt realize before purchase the top of the heater was metal. Was going to use for my kitchen but not with a toddler running around who could potentially touch and burn their hand.

"UTV/Golf Cart Portable Propane Heater, 4,000 BTU Winter Fall Outdoors, Stay Warm",118.5, ,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

"Fahrenheat FUH54 5,000-W 240V Garage/Outdoor Fan Forced Heater  *** LAST ONE ***", , ,"['I received this unit via FedEx last Saturday afternoon and I had it installed, wired, and running by Saturday evening.  For wiring I used 10/2 + grnd. and 30A circuit.  The unit seems to be very solidly build and it was easy to hang without any assistance.  I have seen some reviews that stated the fan is noisy but in my opinion it is not objectionable.  My workshop is long and narrow and this unit throws air adequately the length of the shop.  I have approx. 600 sq ft well-insulated workshop.  The first cold snap of the year is coming this week, I think my timing was perfect!My only criticism of the unit is in regards to the electrical connections.  The unit only has a 1/2"" knockout which I had to enlarge to accommodate my 3/4"" connector.  Also, the electrical connector block is located near a corner and didn\'t give much room for connecting heavy wire.  The connection block could have easily been located away from the corner giving adequate working space.All-in-all this seems like a solid, well build unit.  My only quibbles are in regards to the convenience of electrical connectivity, thus my reduction of one star from my review.', ""Only brand I'll buy. Mine was Quiet not real noisey. I just like the way it runs. I feel its made better. It works for me. Nice heat that comes out. If you want a bigger one there's a 7500 watt."", 'keeps my drafty two car garage in the upper 50s to low 60s wen its 20 degrees and blowing outside build quality is as I had hoped for Strong fan and heating element throws a nice warm breeze 15 to 20 feet away', ""I bought this heater for use as supplemental heat in my well insulated 30' x 48' shop with 12' ceilings. The shop is divided in to two work areas, The larger 30' x 26' bay is heated with circulated hot water through the floor. The floor is heated to 55 or 60 degrees as to not tax the hot water heater and pump. The shop temp can drop to mid 40's when the outside temp drops into the low 20's. This heater was rated for use for only 500 sq ft, but like I stated it's for supplemental heat. With the heater set two clicks from off, it cycles on and off every 45 minutes to an hour, and doesn't run very long,  but keeps the shop in the low 60's when outside temp is low 20's.

"Mr. Heater 18,000 BTU Portable Tough Buddy Propane Heater - NEW",119.59, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.

I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used.

It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don‚Äôt aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Broan 157 Aluminum Radiant Ceiling Heater With Long Life Element & Built-In Fan,119.0,30-day returns,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation. The power to the heater tested good.', ""Love this little heater, just renivating my Mum's home.   It's so nice to have this little heater in the basement bath.

Mr Heater F232000 Portable Buddy Heater 4000 and 9000 BTU Hr Standard,115.89,30-day returns,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‚Äò88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank.

Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.

Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don‚Äôt aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]",,Mr. Heater,"Electric, Gas, Propane",,Not Electric,Mr. Heater Buddy MH18B,"Red, Gray, Yellow, Black",Indoor/Outdoor,,,"F274805, F274800, F274885, MH18B",,,,0089301004825,,,,,,"Unit Heater, Portable Oil Filled Radiator",,,,,,,,,,,18000,"Rotary Knob, Switch",Radiant,,Garage,Quiet,,,,,,250 to 499 sq ft,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The heater puts out enough heat to warm up my 24' x x24' garage on a cold winters day (in Michigan).  With it's 3 settings (Lo, Med &amp; Hi) I start on Hi to raise the temp, then I set it to Lo to maintain temp.  I like the idea that the LP tank is built into the heater (instead of a separate tank and extension hose).  It makes the heater easy to roll around the shop and set it where the heat is needed.  I've had no issues with it not starting or operating properly.All in all, this is one great little portable heater.  I'd definitely but it again."", 'It is exactly what we needed. Works great and heats fast. Great product.', 'It is used every day sometimes three or four times to take the chill off in my 14 x 30 cabin. Fifteen min. or so is all it takes even when it is 12 fa outside. Wish I had it last year. Thanks Mr Heater !', ""I've had this heater for a month now and have used it in my garage. It works great in the garage even when it was 20 degrees outside. On high, I have to sit about 2 feet away or I start to get too hot. I normally turn it to medium setting once I start getting hot. It takes about 5 minutes to get up to full heat, and very minimum fumes.  I'm still using my first tank of gas! I love this heater!"", 'This heater holds a 20-pound propane tank. It does a good job of providing radiant heat. The pilot light ignites automatically, making the heater easy to use. I am happy with it, although I have used it only three times so far.', 'fast shipping and heats up the area we needed it for quit fast', 'Works great, Gives off perfect amount of heat with the three settings.Recommended to anyone that is cold, and on a budget for heat.I first learned of these while in Greece in the navy. we used them over winter, where the climate was not so cold, but, you still needed something for quick heat to take the chill off.']","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.

DeLonghi TRH0715 Safeheat 1500-Watt Oil-Filled Radiant Portable Heater SILENT,119.99, ,"[""Just replaced a (20+) year old Delonghi unit of same wattage as the open box replacement heater just received.  Although deeply discounted with a bent heating fin, it powered up fine and should heat my den / kitchen fall to spring for the yearly cost savings I've come to expect.  After the suprisingly long service life of the first unit, this latest purchase should be more than satisfactory."", '12/20/2019 - The Delonghi Space Heaters last for many, many years. They provide excellant heat and are easy to operate. I ""Highly Recommend"" these units for anybody !....', ""Complete garbage. It was a least 10 yrs old. Broken coming apart at welded seams. Splattered paint all over it. Rusted nuts and rivets. The power cord was frayed and unsafe also hadn't been plugged in for a long while cause the plug was corroded like the terminals on a car battery. I got ripped off for $95.00. Could have bought a brand new one for that ; which I thought I was doing on E-Bay."", 'We enclosed a covered patio and needed a heater for winter. Room is 160 sqft with average insulation.Heater keeps room comfortable with outside temps down to 10 degrees.To be honest I was surprised how well this worked. I was skeptical that a heater with no fan could heat a room.  This does a great job and is completely silent, except for a faint click when it cycles on and off.Highly recommend for a small room like mine.', 'We purchased this unit thinking that it would break the chill in our bedroom but all we got was minimal heating benefit and double our energy usage!  I do not recommend this unit.', 'I needed a heater to heat my 1400 sq ft retail space. I did research using google.com to find the most reliable and energy efficient space heater I could find. The DeLonghi TRH9715 consistently was recomended on several sites. It also had the bonus of no fumes, no maintenance, and though it give a mild burn if it is touched too long, it wont maim and scar-for-life if a child were to accidentally bump into it. I also like how fast it will heat up my large space and that I can turn it off and the warm oil will continue to emit a gentle warms for a couple hours after it is off... thus saving me money on my power bill. I have been using the DeLonghi Oil heater for about 3 weeks and I have zero complaints or dislikes. It is a great heater.', ""I have a small 1 bedroom apartment in a two story apartment building in which the living room and kitchen are sandwiched in between an apartment to the left, to the right, and one above. So it is always warm in those 2 rooms. However, my bedroom is on the backside of the house underneath the porch/stairway leading to the apartment above. The ceiling in my bedroom has apparently not been insulated, as once the heat rises, it's gone. On top of that, for whatever reason, whoever built the place never put any baseboard heaters in the bedroom. So needless to say, the bedroom and bathroom get very cold during a New England winter. I used to have a Pelonis oil-filled heater, it barely heated the area around my bed,  burned out within a year. I have since purchased the DeLonghi TRH0715 oil-filled heater and absolutely love it. I put it on about an hour before I go to bed, and keep it on Medium #4 for most of the night, and by about 4:00am I'm having to either turn it to low, or even off, because it is nice and toasty in my room. I will never settle for cheaper again, DeLonghi is the best oil-filled heater out there, hands down."", 'I have used this product for over 15 years to heat a small cottage. I just replaced it with a newer version.Very efficient, well-made, and quiet. For safety reasons, always unplug any portable heat source when not in use.', 'Unit provides quiet steady heat.  No fan to clog with dust, no noise, just radiational heat in all directions.  10x better than any fan forced heater.', 'Delonghi makes the best oil filled heaters. They are heavier, which means they hold the heat longer, more efficient. They are very quite. I prefer the simpler models without the timers or digital bells and whistles. Less parts to have problems with.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

EdenPURE A5095 Gen2 Pure Infrared Heater with Remote Control - READ,119.95, ,"[""This is a great heater. This is actually our 2nd one. We loved the 1st one so much that we decided to purchase another.  It does a good job of heating our living area. It doesn't seem to increase our electric bills by much. And it's much cheaper to use than heater fuel. I would recommend this heater for any one. "", 'Purchased this to supplement heat in my cold basement (I live in Michigan). It does the job for that quite well.  Not sure how the energy use will be as I have not been billed yet. I like that it is quiet.  I am using it to supplement the heat in an area that is considerably larger than what the heater should heat, but since it is a supplemental heat source, it works great maintaining a comfortable temperature in the entire area. The timer option is useful and the fact that it is thermostatically controlled (digital readout, so you know what the setting actually is) is good. It was a good investment for my purposes, as otherwise it would be difficult to spend much time in my basement workshop in the winter.', 'I have used this brand and model in my greenhouse for several years. The thermostat control protects my tender plants and turns off in the hot sun. I use this product from Mid-February through Mid-May.', 'I bought this heater not knowing what to expect, but it has done an excellent job. I ended up buying 2 and I am heating a 2400 square ft building with 2 of them. They run quiet, and are cool to the touch. I am really pleased with them.', ""My friend has the older version edenPure (same BTU) and it puts out a LOT of heat. The gen 2? Not so much... I bought the gen 2 based on the brand, and I'm not impressed at all. I think I would have been better off with a cheap ceramic heater for a lot less $."", ""I really like this heater. It is my second Eden Pure. It heats up my apartment so quickly and is so quiet.I love the size too. I have barely had to use it because Winter hasn't gotten here yet!"", 'It does an OK job of keeping the chill off, no where near as good as the last edenpure I had. It would warm you right up and lasted for many years. This one just does not have the same power that one did. But like I say when it is too warm for the CH and too chilly for nothing it does the job.', 'These are awesome heaters, I had one of the first ones when they came out, loved it, one of the good things about these heaters is that you can gets parts for them if ever you need them but I can say that it will be a long time before you will ever need to, I would recommend buying one.', 'This is a very efficient way to heat your home or office.

Lasko Space Heater 24.9 in. x 16.65 in. With Digital Display And A Timer In Tan,116.63, ,"['The Lasko Cyclonic ceramic Heater is a great choice to heat a room.  Why?  well, here is what I think about my new heater.First, i was looking for a heater to use in my 160 Sq ft shop, that didn\'t take up a whole bunch of space. The Lasko heater is a good compact size, unlike Baseboard heaters that take up three to five or more feet of wall space, where you can\'t put things in front of them, this heater is only about 17"" wide.  Or my former oil radiator heater, that works well, but I had to pull it out from the wall to use it, as it gets hot all around it.This heater will heat a larger room, but I chose it because I wanted a fairly fast warm up, when I start to work.  I chose Electric because I don\'t want fumes or have to worry about getting Propane, or Kerosene.  I like the feel of the Electric heat.This heater has a thermostat that can be set, and a timer if you want it to go off by itself. Very Convenient !  It draws the cool air from the floor, and blows warm air out the top, from it\'s moveable ( up and down) exhaust.  The Fan forced air can travel most of the way across the room, which helps circulate the warmth evenly.The heater fan has two speeds so it\'s quiet enough to use in a bedroom if you want, and can be put right up against the wall so it\'s out of the way.I have used this in my shop for several days now, some as cold as 25 degrees outside, and this Lasko heater warms the shop up to a comfortable (for me) 68 deg. in about 30 minutes.Because it\'s only 25"" tall, the temperature the display on the front says, may need to be adjusted to your own likings, but I\'ve found once the whole room has warmed up the temp. displayed is within 2 degrees of the Thermometer I have on the other end of the room.So it does keep up with the set temperature when in thermostat mode fairly well. You can just have it on low heat or high heat all the time, but I like the convenience of the thermostat mode. It\'s simple to operate, and comes in several colors, to match your decor. While the housing is mostly Plastic, the Heater is sturdy enough. Because it is only 6.5"" deep, it stays tucked up tight ot the wall out of my way, and doesn\'t heat up the wall, like my oil/electric radiator did, but fear not if you tip it over, it has automatic shutoff.I don\'t have any complaints about this heater. I think it\'s just about perfect for small shops like mine, or a cold bedroom , or even to heat larger areas. Lasko made a good all around Electric heater here.', ""i've been using these for 7yrs now, after 4yrs took apart and cleaned them (i have 5) and even the 7yr old works as it did when new, i dont like to waste money so i have stuck with this model, i have the electronic version also (black)at another location, they are okay but not built the same inside, these seem to be better built, they do what they are designed to do, and i always use the ceiling fan to bring the heat down and mix it up so they dont run forever. i run 1 in each bedroom and two in the living room, not too loud, i know they are not a furnace, temperature at the grill is abt 200 degrees coming out so i use the ceiling fans on low or medium to help mix it up otherwise all the heat stays up at the ceiling. I feel this is the best heater in this class."", 'Nice heater that does a great job. Already own 6. Is an inexpensive way to heat house and safer as well. Does not impact the electric bill hardly any at all. Do not have to worry about tipping over, has solid stand. I use to use gas as a means of heating my two story house until I found this type of heater. I have purchased four or five other heaters of this type for relatives and friends.', ""bought two of them in the past 2 years and both of them were defective. I have one that is 10 to 15 years old and still works. that's why i wanted one the same brand. MUST NOT BE TESTING THEM !!!"", 'Unstable. No tip over feature. Never stopped outgassing plastic smell.', 'Borrowed a lasko heater last year coverage was great economical and safe so bought the same model very happy with it!', 'This heater works safely when it is sitting against the wall. To adjust to any temperature is very easy. It also shows the actual temperature in the area.', 'I purchased this heater, to use in my RV.  It is quite efficient.  Enjoying the efficiency and temperature control.  ', ""I now own three (3) of 'em... The oldest one is starting its 5th winter.  "", ""OUR LIVING ROOM IS BIG AND WE KEEP THE THERMOSTAT DOWN TO 68 WE NEEDED AN EXTRA HEATER TO HELP KEEP IT WARMER. WE DO NOT LIKE IT HOT TO SLEEP SO WE TRIED THIS. REALLY LIKE IT CAN STAND IT AGAINST THE WALL AND NO WORRIES. THE AIR IS DRAWN IN THE BOTTOM AND COMES OUT THE TOP NICE AND WARM.THE ONLY CHANGE I WOULD MAKE IS FOR THE AIR TO BE DRAWN IN THE TOP AND COME OUT THE BOTTOM NICE AND WARM,DUE TO COLD FLOORS. TRIED TO FIND ONE BUT DIDN'T. ANYHOW, THIS HEATER IS VERY GOOD.EASY TO MOVE. STURDY ENOUGH TO STAY STANDING.  *****    FIVE STARS""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Comfort Zone CZ230ER Fan Heater,115.0, ,"[""This replaced a 40 y/o unit that worked, but not well. Having the remote control makes temperature control much easier. The high mode provides instant heat when used and the guide vanes direct the flow well. I did replace the circuit breaker as this unit has a max draw of 31.4 amps (7500 watts)on high mode, and insured the wiring and connections were proper. It's below freezing outside and this unit cycles and maintains 63-68 degrees with a 72 degree setting. The area is an insulated 900 sqft and the temperature is read on the wall furthest from the unit. Until I get a better primary heat source this is a great unit to have till then."", ""The heater is built pretty tough, which is a good thing. I also found it easy to connect, which interestingly enough was more expensive for the materials than it was for the heater. Only problem is that it doesn't heat as well as advertised. It claimed to heat an area (uninsulated) that was 30x30. my garage is 25x35 so I figured that was basically the same thing. after running for an hour or more it only brought the temp up from 45* to about 52*. I guess that if I left it running all the time it would eventually gey there, but that was not what I was hoping for. Plus, those temps were only for the emediate area around the heater, the far end of the garage was still ice cold. In any account it is a good heater for the price. especially if you already have a place wired for it."", ""Havent used it yet, but looks nice. It's smaller than I thought but as long as it heats good then I'm ok with it. I was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the plug. Luckily I have an extra one. I will have it hooked up in a couple of days. Thanks. "", ""Installed in my 2 car garage, used the correct 8ga wire and double pole breaker. On high setting, it trips the breaker. Tried a different breaker, no luck. It doesn't heat the garage as well as I anticipated, but better than having no heater at all. I like the remote, it works well. Heater is quiet. Not impressed but whatever. I may end up moving it to my basement, where I believe it may work better. "", 'After researching different heater I found this to be the best deal, but the heat sensor is on the inside witch makes it shut off sooner than it should so I located it on the outside and it now works good. I also looked on youtube to see how to hook up 220w and found it to be really easy but make sure you use 8/3 wire and a 40amp double pull breaker for safety reasons. I have a 24x30 insulated garage with 8 foot ceilings and at 32 degrees it will heat up at about 10 degrees an hour and after a while when the heat is up a little bit it seems to heat up faster so I use my kerosene heater to speed things up a little and when it gets around 68 degrees this heater can maintain very easy. now just so you know I have 4 metal cars in my garage that retain cold air for quite a while so your garage might heat up faster depending what you have in it', ""I purchased this unit to replace my old one. The unit arrived very quickly. I think it took 4 days to get to me. Packaging was very stout, no damage to the unit. I did have a friend of mine help me install it but it wasn't really hard and could have done it in a pinch. Instructions were easy to read. I have a 25x25 sq ft shop, insulated to about R4 and this heater does a nice job of warming it with outside temps around around 32F. This unit is also nice in that I have a choice of hi or lo elements used to heat.I would recommend this and install it myself if I go to a larger building."", 'Great price, great size, easy to use', ""Not happy with this heater. First of all, the thermostat is not correct, as it is located INSIDE the heater where it stays hot. Must be set much much higher for desired temp. Second, and worst of all, when the heater switches ON or OFF, it makes a extremely loud BANG. Really disappointing for the price and would return it if it wasn't hard wired in. Regret buying the warranty, as I don't plan on keeping past it's first breakdown."", 'The temperature sensor is mounted in a way that the heater cuts off way before room temperature is reached.  Believe the sensor is getting reading from the case rather than ambient temperature.  ', 'Well Made. Easy to use. Shipping was fast, with damage. Easy to install. Easy to hang. Would highly recommend it if the square footage is right and it is insulated.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

In the day time, it is hard to see the setting due to the poor lighting on the temperature.', 'Excellent way to heat.  Cost effective.  One flaw is that there is a ""tip-over shut-off switch"" that won\'t reset if the unit is knocked over rendering it useless thereafter.  I have owned 8 units before and two went forever inop.  None-the-less, I will continue buying this heater.', 'Save time here.....just got it a few weeks ago, so a bit early to really tell.  Seems fine so far... ;-)', 'Lightweight. Does the job.

MRHEATER F242010 Liquid Propane Golf Cart Heater Cup Holder Adapter Camping,115.6,60-day returns,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

Mr. Heater MH9BX 9000 BTU Propane Portable Buddy Heater- MH9BX ( Free Shipping)¬†,120.0, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‚Äò88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

My other larger cabinet one blows slower and much quieter. I really wish it had fan speeds. Lot louder.Tip for the day,Some people complain these heaters wont heat the room. Make sure and close the doors of the room. But the other room is venting warmer air into the cooler room you say. Does not matter close the doors and it will work.', ""Great little heater, I live in an apartment I use it in my living room when I get chilled it helps bring my room temperature up so I'm not setting here freezing it really does help for a small space heater it works just like the larger ones it has temperature control it comes with a remote control you can turn it on and off set the temperature I'm using it right now"", 'item works great for room heating. they are a very safe heater.

Mr. Heater Big Buddy MH18B Portable Propane Heater - Red open box never used,116.0, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don‚Äôt aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.
