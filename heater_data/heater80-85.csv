Open Box Dr Infrared Heater DR-968 Portable Space Heater 1500-Watt Brown Wood,81.0, ,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit. Doesn't even look like a heater, more like a piece of furniture or a speaker for a high end stereo system."", 'I hen purchase several brands of infrared heaters .   Dr. Heater is built solid .  Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won‚Äôt last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.

Mr. Heater MH-F215100 3800 BTU Portable Little Buddy Propane Emergency Heat,83.99,"1,353 sold","['Even though it cost almost 1 1/2 One Pound Coleman tanks from 9pm to 5am,  it‚Äôs great. Keeps my whole RV toasty warm. I would recommend by a large propane tank to refill the 1 pound tanks. Much cheaper. But I‚Äôve not been cold once. The safety feature of turning off it it tilts is great. Only problem I have found is the bottom piece you place on propane tank does not secure properly and falls off when lifted off the ground to move the heater. ', 'This little buddy heater is a fine unit for use in an ice fishing shelter or flip over sled / tent. It is the right size and has a small footprint.The angle of the head heating element is perfect for warming wet hands and can be easily aimed to direct the heater output.The only down side is that it can be difficult to light in even the slightest breeze.', ""This is just the right amount of heat and size  for my needs compared to the regular Mr. Heater but does not hold up to heavy use. Have had a regular size that I use in an icefishing house that has years of use on it. The little buddies I've had are lucky to make an ice season before getting had to light and the just quitting. Love the little buddies while they work but the regular Mr buddy is a much better long term value."", 'I bought this to heat my ice fishing hut and only used it a handful of times. Looks like it‚Äôs made pretty durable, the igniter works good, like the carry handle, the metal shield cools down pretty quick if you want to move spots. The negatives are the sensor for the automatic shut off is way too sensitive, if you dont have it pretty close to PERFECTLY flat it goes out which is a pain. Also there is no heat control so once it‚Äôs first lit it‚Äôs just barely staying lit, can‚Äôt have any wind blow on it or it goes out, plus once the honeycomb section is lit well finally and red it‚Äôs burning propane at such a low rate heat does not blow out of it, it only rises from it. I guess the plus to that is low propane consumption but it would be nice to be able to crank it up if you want to blow some heat at you. This is a new school version of a metal coffee can with a roll of toilet paper inside soaked in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol. ', ""These things do a good job of heating my small fish house, but it does not take long and they get hard to light and won't work Have gone through three in three ice fishing seasons.. The regular size Mr. Heater is more reliable and I should probably just stick with those but the smaller size and a bit less btu's just works better in my tiny and very well insulated fish house.Have tried the cleaning method described in the manual but it is very hard to take apart and nothing seems to help."", 'Bought 3 fir use to heat bedrooms in the house during power outages.  Just arrived and a week later a planned one day power outage.  With new born baby, needed to ensure both mom and baby would stay warm.  Used the heater and it was fine.

So I bought this for our RTT roof top tent ..works good don't get as hot which is good for a tent ,But! the base that holds the 1lb tank should be twice the size feels like it could fall over .I plan on fabricating a larger base :)                                                                        -=CC=-"", ""Not cheap. It is tippy with the 1 lb cylinder. I asked Mr Heater for a parts list to hard pipe it directly to a 5 lb or 20 lb cylinder and I got parts list for using a hose. I don't want to use a hose. I like that it is quiet. I like that you don't need matches. I wish it had more than 1 heat output setting. It seems to be the best match available of heat output needed for my collapsible fish house."", ""I used this in my motorhome to keep the chill off at night and not have to use the furnace, which runs the batteries down significantly while boon-docking. It will run for 6 hours on one propane bottle, so it will not last all night. However, if you start it at midnight, it will run until 6 AM, at which time you can turn on your furnace for a short time if you're an early riser. Alternatively, if you don't want to run the furnace in order to save batteries, you could light the burners on your stove. Be sure to crack a window so as not to deplete all the oxygen.

DuraHeat Portable Electric Space Heater 1500-Watt Pivoting Base,80.69,Last item available,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.

Have been using a small oscillating ceramic heater for a couple years, but not thermostat controlled. Love the Lasko, cause it heats room evenly and quickly! Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature.

Lasko Oscillating Space Heater 1500-Watt Thermostat Timer Indoor Plastic Gray,80.6,30-day returns,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood.

Lasko Electric Portable Ceramic Oscillating Space Heater 1500-Watt Remote,80.58,30-day returns,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater. And If I have to replace any one of the heaters I have, it will be with a Lasko 5572 heater.HJ of Missouri', ""We were absolutely thrilled with the size and capability of this room heater.

Not only does it produce heat well but it is also is aesthetically pleasing in an office setting.  Those points combined with many levels of heat to chose from and a remote control feature to boot...perfection!!  Three purchases and each for less than $60...it's a winner!!"", ""The reason I wanted this heater was I needed supplemental heat to my daughters room which is the furthest from the central heating system and surrounded by three ouside walls. Have been using a small oscillating ceramic heater for a couple years, but not thermostat controlled. Love the Lasko, cause it heats room evenly and quickly! Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature. If you can run it on High which draws 12-14 Amps then it will work well for you! Why they disable temperature controlled operation in Low mode is baffling to me! ', 'This heater is a pretty good source of additional warmth where you need it. You may get tired of people asking you what it is though... It will not heat an entire home, but in my 22x28 living room, it does a pretty good job warming things up. Quiet and pretty. The remote works great, (even though it is almost as weird of a shape as the heater).', ""The heater is very dependable , I've had one for 1 year now. I have purchased two additional for other rooms. These units do the job of heating rooms well. They're very fashionable convenient."", 'first off gotta say this heater warms a medium size room very fast..and very wellalso easy to operate. only problem is the heater is very noise. looked over the reviewspeople said very quit very little sound NOT true loud fan and when oscillating is onmakes a verroom verroom sound [ best way to describe it]  gonna need to get out theear plugs gave it four stars for its heating', ""This little heater is great for taking the chill out of the air. My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me. (Don't rely on this heater being your main source of heat but rather as a supplement)."", ""expertbenefitsI haven't had it too long but it fits my purpose. I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable. It kind of cute too!"", 'I like the design of the heater very much and it certainly has enough output to heat what I intended it for.  I also like the features that it offers.  The only thing that I wish it did and it does not do is turn back on when the thermostat goes below what it is set at as well as turn off when it reaches the temperature.  All in all though, it is a good value and I have been pleased with it.', ""Granted it's not more than 1000 square feet, but this pretty little heater sits in the center of my house and keeps the whole house comfortable.  It has a thermostat,  (only 5 degree increments) but still will save me money by shutting off when the room is warm enough.  It has a convenient remote control.

LASKO 5521 PRODUCTS RC CERAMIC TOWER HEATER,84.88,30-day returns,"['Great space heater.  I purchased it for my very large bedroom.   It did the job in no time.My only suggestion, though, is that the heater run only when in the room.

Lasko 751320 1500W Built-In Ceramic Tower Heater 23 in. with Remote Control,84.03,30-day returns,"['I giving it 4 stars because when I started it for the first time.. It gave weird smell for about an hour or so. After that it has been working excellent. Its very easy to setup. Nothing much needed, just plug and start. It comes with a remote control using which we can control the temperature and speed. When I was at graduate school, my friend used to have it for his room since that room used to be cold in our apartment. It used to work fine there, so I purchased for my room at my current apartment. ', ""I really haven't had to use it yet, for my apartment gets very warm because of the sun coming in on my windows which face west, but I did try it out and it is certainly easy to use."", 'This is an awesome heater for the price that I have paid.Pros:1. It can warm up the room quickly with different temperature setup2. It has the auto feature where it goes to sleep mode when the temperature in room reaches the set value and restarts whenever it goes lower beyond the set value3. It can oscillate like a tower fan and distribute the heat across the room4. Its light weightCons:1. It has the remote but during night you cant see the temperature that we have set on this humidifier. Having a display in the remote or on the humidifier itself', ""This is the second one I've purchased. The heater itself is a good value, and the oscillating feature, and remote control are an added bonus. Used my first purchase in my camper (2 years and still going strong). This one's for our home's enclosed porch."", ""I think the heater works well, But when you have a power outage you have to reset it to keep area warm. The controls don't allow it to pick up where, hear left off trying to heat area.   So that make this heater, not reliable for keeping kids warm, pets,  plants.  In the areas I have lived would even help prevent frozen water lines.  I makes heater like this only good for you if, your attending it.  If this heat had manual controls it would be better. or had a program to reboot and maintain a pre-set temp,  by factory or,  by the user.  Myself I like a electric  heater that works  as lone as I have power.  And  starts back up after a power outage.  Have a great day."", ""This heater doesn't oscillate on all the temperatures. Only oscillates from 75 and up."", 'Got this heater for my camp trailer. Might as well use a candle for heat.  . It would be fine if it had a fan inside it.

Very disappointed !', 'I wish I could set temperature between 65 and 70, otherwise very good heater', ""What can you say, they are quite, thermostat adjustable, put out a tremendous amount of heat for their size, timered, remote control and oscillates.With out question best heaters that are portable I've ever owned."", 'When my other heater died I ordered the Lasko heater because I know that Lasko products are well made and have a good reputation.

Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one üò© as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit.

DuraHeat 1500-Watt Portable Electric Space Heater with Pivoting Base,85.0, ,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time. I put the heater in max mode and not matter what it just wasn't throwing out enough heat.You literally have to be right in front of the heater to feel anything. I wanted something affordable that was not powered by propane however they do say u get what you paid for."", ""I bought two of these for my garage and disregarded the previous reviews i read. The fan barely puts air out. It gets hot, but the fan almost seems like the motor is junk. I'll still use it. I'll just put a box fan behind it so it can actually move heat around."", ""The heater is built well and is safe however its useless in a garage or outdoors. I would recommend it for use in a indoor room or basement environment where it doesn't have to compete with more harsh temperatures. Not exactly what I was hoping for!"", 'This looks good in the pictures, but is a terrible heater. The forced air is a joke. Plus it does not get hot.

It makes hardly any noise and swivels so it gets all sides of the room.

Lasko Remote Control Ceramic Tower Heater with Digital Display 755320,84.91,30-day returns,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one üò© as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit. The Oscillation can be Set by The Remote as well. PROS: Great Designed Unit.

Mr. Heater Portable Buddy MH9BX 9000 BTU 225 SQ Ft Propane Heater MH9BX,84.99, ,"[""This is a fantastic small space heater.  It heats up quickly and puts off a generous amount of heat for it's size.  It can heat a small room, or keep you warm when working outdoors in cool weather.  I hate having cold hands and this heater keeps me from not being able to do my mechanic work in the cold. With the built in safety features, I feel confident there won't be any problems.  I have several of the 1 lb propane bottles so I don't urn short.  Also if you get one of these heaters, pick up the propane bottle refill adapter sold on Amazon or elsewhere so you can fill the 1 lb bottles from your 20 lb tanks.  It's easy and way more economical. I have Electric heaters, but for outdoors, or when the power goes out, there's nothing like a Mr. Heater to help keep you warm.  It's small enough to take with you, but puts out more heat than the Electrics can.  Just use common sense where and how you use it, and all will be fine.   "", ""We have another Mr. Heater that works fine. However, the one I'm writing about here (just received) has a weak piezo spark emitter.

Lasko Portable Heater 1500-Watt Auto Shut Off Cool-to-the-Touch Nonslip Base,84.1,30-day returns,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element.

I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater.

The other heater's slot is angled so your fingers don't slip out.  The one remote does control either heater.  I recommended my satisfaction to a friend and he bought one and is happy with it.

Have been using a small oscillating ceramic heater for a couple years, but not thermostat controlled. Love the Lasko, cause it heats room evenly and quickly! Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature. If you can run it on High which draws 12-14 Amps then it will work well for you! Why they disable temperature controlled operation in Low mode is baffling to me!

My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me.

I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable. It kind of cute too!"", 'I like the design of the heater very much and it certainly has enough output to heat what I intended it for.  I also like the features that it offers.  The only thing that I wish it did and it does not do is turn back on when the thermostat goes below what it is set at as well as turn off when it reaches the temperature.  All in all though, it is a good value and I have been pleased with it.', ""Granted it's not more than 1000 square feet, but this pretty little heater sits in the center of my house and keeps the whole house comfortable.  It has a thermostat,  (only 5 degree increments) but still will save me money by shutting off when the room is warm enough.  It has a convenient remote control.

Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time. I put the heater in max mode and not matter what it just wasn't throwing out enough heat.You literally have to be right in front of the heater to feel anything. I wanted something affordable that was not powered by propane however they do say u get what you paid for."", ""I bought two of these for my garage and disregarded the previous reviews i read. The fan barely puts air out. It gets hot, but the fan almost seems like the motor is junk. I'll still use it. I'll just put a box fan behind it so it can actually move heat around."", ""The heater is built well and is safe however its useless in a garage or outdoors.

Not exactly what I was hoping for!"", 'This looks good in the pictures, but is a terrible heater. The forced air is a joke. Plus it does not get hot.

Optimus H-9010 Garage/Shop Ceiling or Wall Mount Utility Heater,84.99,30-day returns,"[""The radiant heat is amazingly effective in warming a small space--much more than an equivalent wattage hot air heater. My only criticism is the very thin, flexible mounting bracket. I had to use a 1x4 board behind it to securely mount it to my wall. I don't want to yank the power cord very hard, either."", ""This is definitely not meant for a cold garage.  Although it does radiate heat, it is not enough to warm any type of area more than a couple feet from the heater.  Since the heat rises, there just isn't enough warm air to help except near your head.  It might work better inside the house, rather than the garage.  As with so many heaters, a fan would sure help blow the warmer air around."", ""I hung this from my garage ceiling over my work bench and dogs' beds.  It's simple, light, and easy to mount.  Has 3 output options: 1) light only, 2) light + 1 element, or 3) light + both elements.  Output is silent, soft steady heat, not fan-blown.  The pull cord is very handy- the heater takes up no floor space, but can easily be turned on from the ground with 8'-9' ceilings (you can add to the cord for x-high ceilings).I would recommend this if you are looking to quietly heat a smaller area like a workshop or shed, or to simplly add heat to one section of a larger area (about 200sqrft).  It's perfect for adding some heat over my workbench area, but isn't powerful enough to heat my entire garage quickly.  I would recommend buying 2 for a 2-car garage(400sqrft) or 3 for a 3-car (600sqrft) for example.Additionally, I would not recommend this as a source of radiant heat for outdoor areas like patios.  It doesn't offer that kind of output and isn't meant for it."", 'I mounted the heater in my garage on the ceiling. For added support, I added L brackets and zip ties to be sure the screws don‚Äôt pull out of the rafter/drywall over time. Heater puts out good heat to supplement another heater in my garage. The small light is like a  good-sized flashlight. I wanted to add heat so the light wasn‚Äôt important to me. I do not expect it to heat a huge space so it does what I need.', ""I wouldn't recommend this heater it's very cheaply made and doesn't look like it will last very long. The clips  that hold the bulbs in place on mine all fell off during shipping, so that says something about the quality. I had to take it apart which isn't an easy task to try to put them back on. The mounting bracket is very flimsy and doesn't give you a lot of confidence that it won't fall off where ever it's mounted. I would pass on this heater, it's Chinese junk in my opinion. It heats okay I guess but nothing to write home about."", 'Works great but the wall mount is cheaply made and bends really easily.

Lasko 5812 Air-Flow Heater with Temperature-Regulation System,80.72, ,"[""With the cold grip of a long winter making the house too chilly to stay comfortable, I looked for some space heaters to help out the central A/C system.

For its size, this compact ceramic heater does a good job of keeping my feet warm and taking the chill out of any room where it is employed. A bigger than expected fan motor, quiet operation and good performance makes this a 'top pick' portable heater for the price."", ""Best heater on the market, so far. Heat where ever you put it very efficiently to the point, at times, I findmyself turning it down. Have one in my room, and the bathroom, which I let my brother hold for his room, so gonna get another for the bathroom, and one for the kitchen, because we're rarely in the living room. We're able to turn the gas hear off for the entire winter, and use it only to cook and wash clothes, with agas bill of less than $40 a month. The electric is a little higher than normal due to the heater, but nowherenear what utilities would normally cost with the gas included.

They're very fashionable convenient."", 'first off gotta say this heater warms a medium size room very fast..and very wellalso easy to operate. only problem is the heater is very noise. looked over the reviewspeople said very quit very little sound NOT true loud fan and when oscillating is onmakes a verroom verroom sound [ best way to describe it]  gonna need to get out theear plugs gave it four stars for its heating', ""This little heater is great for taking the chill out of the air. My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me. (Don't rely on this heater being your main source of heat but rather as a supplement)."", ""expertbenefitsI haven't had it too long but it fits my purpose. I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable. It kind of cute too!"", 'I like the design of the heater very much and it certainly has enough output to heat what I intended it for.  I also like the features that it offers.  The only thing that I wish it did and it does not do is turn back on when the thermostat goes below what it is set at as well as turn off when it reaches the temperature.  All in all though, it is a good value and I have been pleased with it.', ""Granted it's not more than 1000 square feet, but this pretty little heater sits in the center of my house and keeps the whole house comfortable.  It has a thermostat,  (only 5 degree increments) but still will save me money by shutting off when the room is warm enough.  It has a convenient remote control.  First time I used it I smelled some electrical burning sent.  It only lasted a little while.  Seems fine now.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Lasko 1500W Ceramic Space Heater with Adjustable Thermostat, 754200, Silver",84.15,30-day returns,"['Been using it now for nearly 2 weeks; brutal Ohio winters make this a necessity.  It\'s compact, light and fits just about anywhere.  They do warn that it can discolor floors/carpets etc so I have it on top of a small waist-height cabinet with a piece of glass under it to protect the surface.  I\'m using it in a 12x12 office, and it is more than adequate to the task.  So far I\'ve used it on the first (lower power) setting at about a ""4"" heat setting (about 1/3 of max).  It puts out a tremendous amount of heat with a far reaching blower.  My only reservation is that it\'s a bit loud compared to my old heatwe (a trusty Bionaire I\'d had for about 12 years which finally gave up the ghost).   Can\'t comment on quality/longevity yet but for the money, it\'s a great buy and I recommend it.  As with any portable heating product, I would not run this when no one is in the room to monitor it. ', ""It serves my purpose very well.  My feet are perpetually cold, and these are perfect for that.  These units last a good 3 to 4 years before they start to get a little less efficient and effective. Eventually they do stop working.  Brand new, these are great heaters.  Very quiet heating unit.  Fan isn't overly loud and puts out a good amount of heat at the low setting.  I rarely use it at the high setting until it starts getting older.  I have gone thru 2 of these units in a 10 to 11 year period.  My 2nd one (about 5 years old) is starting to waiver.  I'd suggest getting some compressed air and blowing out the dust that collects at the intake on the rear of the unit to make it last longer.  The one thing I wish it had was a safety sensor that automatically turns it off if it gets tipped over. It does NOT have any safety feature so be mindful about leaving it on!"", 'I bought a pair of these just in case I experienced a furnace problem and needed some heat while getting it repaired or perhaps wanted to heat the garage a bit while working there.  They seem well built, run very quietly and would likely produce 1500 watts at 120 volts (I got 1440 at 117.7 volts).  The lower setting produced about 930 watts at 119 volts.  The cord is 16 AWG with 105C rating, which appears adequately sized.  Although I did not test them for very long, the heaters and fan did turn off when the temperature setting was reduced to a very low level.  My only qualm, for which I reduced a star,  is that there is no switch to turn them off if overturned.  I rotated the units in all directions, but they kept running.  So I would make sure that they are not used on a flammable surface or any possible source of overturning is excluded.  I did not test if the overheating reset would ever turn them off.', 'This heater did a nice job of heating my area at work.  I sit near an outside wall that is very cold some days.  This heater kept me toasty for about six hours then blew the circuit breaker at work.  This item could be improved with an internal resettable circuit breaker protruding from the rear so IT would blow instead of the one at work.  That would be more convenient instead of me being required to call an electrician at work to fix the work breaker.', 'Great little heater that puts out a lot of heat. I live in a converted space that has no central heating, so this little guy is my only source of heat and it does great. Keeps me toasty all night long at about 1/3 of maximum. My only caveat is that it has no tip-over protection. If the dog brushes against the back of it and knocks it over, it does not automatically shut off.', 'Bought this so we did not have to run the heater all night. This little heater works GREAT. Keeps are room at whatever temperature we set the knob at and heats up our master bedroom FAST. The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because after we unplug it from the outlet, the actual plug is HOT. We had to switch to a power strip as we were afraid the heater might blow a fuse as it seems to use a lot of electricity to power.', 'For a small heater it does a really good job.  It is also excellent for small rooms.  The only perk is that the handle is too smallto get a good hold.  But overall great little heater, love the feature it turns on and off automatically by it self when needed!', ""Prior owner. This is the best small space heater. This warms an area very fast. It isn't heavy. The face does get warm. Please just be careful. I recv'd this very quickly. It is really a fair price. Very well built. The previous space heater is still working, about 7 years now. I was just tired of moving it around. It IS that good. Buy this heater. You won't regret this. Just be careful. Thank you!"", ""This little heater will run you out of a 500 sq ft room if left on high. It's no joke. Lasko is a decent brand, not high end but should last 2-3 years....or more but for for 20.00 what would you expect. Dials are easy and built in temperature regulator is a must. I love mine and think it's a great value. I once ran a lasko fan straight 24 hrs - 7 days a week for 2 years without any issue. It started to rust from the moisture in the area or it would probably still be running. Good purchase and I am very pleased."", ""I think a lot of space heaters between 20-40$ are all the similar, they all break or are just as good as broken by the end of the season. This space heater seems of much better quality, even the material seems of high quality, instead of plastic like most. I also like that it's small and wisper quite. I have no complaints. I got it for 20$ which was a fantastic deal but I would have paid 35$ or even more for a heater with this quality. My biggest pro is the size.  Love it!!!""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

I then put it in a 25 gallon bucket and the same thing happened, although not boiling, was still too hot for any pasture animal to drink.

New LASKO 5812 Automatic Air Flow Heater,80.22, ,"[""With the cold grip of a long winter making the house too chilly to stay comfortable, I looked for some space heaters to help out the central A/C system. After checking out just about all of the available products on the market, I spotted the Lasko 5812 heater on Ebay- the ONLY one I could find that directs warm air into the room from the bottom of the unit at floor level. For its size, this compact ceramic heater does a good job of keeping my feet warm and taking the chill out of any room where it is employed. A bigger than expected fan motor, quiet operation and good performance makes this a 'top pick' portable heater for the price."", ""Best heater on the market, so far. Heat where ever you put it very efficiently to the point, at times, I findmyself turning it down. Have one in my room, and the bathroom, which I let my brother hold for his room, so gonna get another for the bathroom, and one for the kitchen, because we're rarely in the living room. We're able to turn the gas hear off for the entire winter, and use it only to cook and wash clothes, with agas bill of less than $40 a month. The electric is a little higher than normal due to the heater, but nowherenear what utilities would normally cost with the gas included. So yes, this heater does actually save you a lot of money in other areas. And it's extremely sturdy, with a tip over mechanism that works even if the heater is slightly tilted.  Highly recommend. "", ""This has been the very best room heater i have ever purchased it keeps the whole room very warm i can even feel it from 5 feet away constructed like a regular furnace but much smaller don't let the size fool you this little heater will put out the heat baby and i will be buying more of them if they are still in stock i would recommend the Lasko 5812 anytime. thanks guys for a great deal that was well worth every penny."", 'It is the most powerful heater I have owned. The first Lasko 5812 lasted 8 and one half years. It gives more heat on high as the duraflame cabinet heater I purchased for $100.00 this past fall. I should have bought another one of these to heat my larger room.', ""This is a great little heater. It takes the chill out of a room. It is small so it doesn't take up much room and has a safety feature which turns it off when tipped over."", 'i like that the heat comes outof the bottom at floor level . heats the room very fast.so far no problems.like the heat control thermostat.', 'great space heater! - compact, easy on-off switch and setting dial, strong flow, quiet, and best of all, even distribution of soft, warm heat. - very satisfied, AAA+. thank you.', 'Great heaters to heat rooms that you are occupying without breaking your bank account.', 'Using this in bathroom on winter mornings; does not get too hot as some can - safer to use.', 'I just got it yesterday.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Two Mr. Heater F215100 MH4B Little Buddy 3800-BTU Indoor Safe Propane. NEW, , ,"['Even though it cost almost 1 1/2 One Pound Coleman tanks from 9pm to 5am,  it‚Äôs great. Keeps my whole RV toasty warm. I would recommend by a large propane tank to refill the 1 pound tanks. Much cheaper. But I‚Äôve not been cold once. The safety feature of turning off it it tilts is great. Only problem I have found is the bottom piece you place on propane tank does not secure properly and falls off when lifted off the ground to move the heater. ', 'This little buddy heater is a fine unit for use in an ice fishing shelter or flip over sled / tent. It is the right size and has a small footprint.The angle of the head heating element is perfect for warming wet hands and can be easily aimed to direct the heater output.The only down side is that it can be difficult to light in even the slightest breeze.', ""This is just the right amount of heat and size  for my needs compared to the regular Mr. Heater but does not hold up to heavy use. Have had a regular size that I use in an icefishing house that has years of use on it. The little buddies I've had are lucky to make an ice season before getting had to light and the just quitting. Love the little buddies while they work but the regular Mr buddy is a much better long term value."", 'I bought this to heat my ice fishing hut and only used it a handful of times. Looks like it‚Äôs made pretty durable, the igniter works good, like the carry handle, the metal shield cools down pretty quick if you want to move spots. The negatives are the sensor for the automatic shut off is way too sensitive, if you dont have it pretty close to PERFECTLY flat it goes out which is a pain. Also there is no heat control so once it‚Äôs first lit it‚Äôs just barely staying lit, can‚Äôt have any wind blow on it or it goes out, plus once the honeycomb section is lit well finally and red it‚Äôs burning propane at such a low rate heat does not blow out of it, it only rises from it. I guess the plus to that is low propane consumption but it would be nice to be able to crank it up if you want to blow some heat at you. This is a new school version of a metal coffee can with a roll of toilet paper inside soaked in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol. ', ""These things do a good job of heating my small fish house, but it does not take long and they get hard to light and won't work Have gone through three in three ice fishing seasons.. The regular size Mr. Heater is more reliable and I should probably just stick with those but the smaller size and a bit less btu's just works better in my tiny and very well insulated fish house.Have tried the cleaning method described in the manual but it is very hard to take apart and nothing seems to help."", 'Bought 3 fir use to heat bedrooms in the house during power outages.  Just arrived and a week later a planned one day power outage.  With new born baby, needed to ensure both mom and baby would stay warm.  Used the heater and it was fine.

So I bought this for our RTT roof top tent ..works good don't get as hot which is good for a tent ,But! the base that holds the 1lb tank should be twice the size feels like it could fall over .I plan on fabricating a larger base :)                                                                        -=CC=-"", ""Not cheap. It is tippy with the 1 lb cylinder. I asked Mr Heater for a parts list to hard pipe it directly to a 5 lb or 20 lb cylinder and I got parts list for using a hose. I don't want to use a hose. I like that it is quiet. I like that you don't need matches. I wish it had more than 1 heat output setting. It seems to be the best match available of heat output needed for my collapsible fish house."", ""I used this in my motorhome to keep the chill off at night and not have to use the furnace, which runs the batteries down significantly while boon-docking. It will run for 6 hours on one propane bottle, so it will not last all night. However, if you start it at midnight, it will run until 6 AM, at which time you can turn on your furnace for a short time if you're an early riser. Alternatively, if you don't want to run the furnace in order to save batteries, you could light the burners on your stove. Be sure to crack a window so as not to deplete all the oxygen.

Original Infrared Portable Space Heater with Dual Heating System 1500-Watt ,81.0, ,"[""Pros-outside of unit not hot if you touch it.it's on wheels, cycles on to adjust set temperature, has a remote, has a timer, safety switches ( temp &amp; if it tips over ). Youtube videos on how to repair unit, parts available. Looks nice, immediate heat, does not deplete oxygen like a ceramic heater, you can breath easily.Cons- 1500 watts &amp; 12.5 amps power used. Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them. Follow all safety warnings, it can be a good heater, don't let your guard down.....be vigilant, be safe, and stay warm. I watch TV with one keeping me warm, and happy."", ""Impressed with quality and many features like holding heat level economically, auto dual fan speeds, easy reading temperature, easy set up and great looking unit. Doesn't even look like a heater, more like a piece of furniture or a speaker for a high end stereo system."", 'I hen purchase several brands of infrared heaters .   Dr. Heater is built solid .  Purchased my last one in 2013.   Warranty is unsurpassed with 3 years .  Most heaters just won‚Äôt last .  Also puts our more heat output than a comparable EdenPure .   Good value and great  quality .', 'It is a hybrid infrared.  60% of the heat comes from a relatively new PTC heater.  40% comes from infrared.  It heats the air and objects in the room at the same time.  I have a small home of 1250 sq. ft.  I have three of these heaters at various places and have been able to shut my gas furnace down entirely.  Since they are very stingy on electricity, my monthly heating bill is now much less than it used to be!  I would recommend this heater to anyone without hesitation!', 'My Dr 968 1500 watt heater produces heat rapidly and cycles on and off to keep the temp where it is set.  This small unit has a fan that is barely audible and manages to push the heat away from the heat elements into the room and keep the area comfortable.  Lots of heat in a small package.', 'Well-built unit. Small, unobtrusive, and quiet. Easy to use with control panel or remote control, and the built-in thermostat works as it should. A nice feature is that the unit is on wheels so makes it easy to roll out of the way when cleaning and vacuuming. Takes the chill off my small place quite nicely. Great to use during those in-between seasons before or after you shut down or turn on the heating system. I am very satisfied with this product!', 'I have read a great deal of reviews from others before my first purchase. I have other brand spot heaters in my collection. Trial by error I suppose. Colorado Winters can be brutal at times. I purchased this for my mothers not well insulated home. a living room and a kitchen connected, 630 sq ft. this heater will keep it at a comfortable temp. for her. All at a low setting.Shuts off as it should to measure the heat in the room and comes back on when it needs to.It is supplemental. It will not heat a whole home.My unit arrived with a cracked frame on the top left corner. It works though, that is my main concern.Stays on five hours as i programmed and shuts off. Good Bang for the Buck. 5200 BTU is a great output for this size The fan is quiet when running. You can watch t.v. without noticing the heater on.In my opinion, if these units are used wisely, they are useful and can save a bit of money on your bill. Thumbs up on this unit.........', ""I bought this to use in a bedroom because it was advertised as quiet, and it came with a remote.  It's not that quiet- just a little quieter than your average cheapo space heater.  And the remote doesn't power the heater on or off- just lets the unit go on standby, which is kind of a drag.  The standby light is so bright i wound up covering it with a piece of paper.  Except for the remote, it's not worth the money."", 'Despite the fact that the first heater stopped working after 4 years I purchased another, Reasons: great features, heats area very well, low cost to operate, compact and easy to move around', ""Product arrived extremely quickly.  I'm using it in a sun-room to keep the temperatures steady for two parrots.  Am not able to determine if I am saving money on this product or not running it continuously versus other types of heating methods.  Product works well - happy so far.""]","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.

DeLonghi TRD40615EBK Oil Filled Radiator Space Heater Quiet 1500W Adjustable,82.58, ,"[""We've had the DeLonghi radiant heater for a couple of months now.  It's being used to heat an insulated basement TV room about 10 x 14 feet.  The basement room gets a small amount of heat from the forced air system that heats the entire house but additional heat is required to reach a comfortable level.  Quite simply the heater doesn't adequately heat this small room. More often than not we end up wearing coats even when the heater is on. The heater is quiet and that's a plus.  But really, who cares if it doesn't keep you warm? Probably best used in a small bathroom."", ""This DeLonghi heater is not for the consumer and the reason why I am saying that is the very low quality of this unit. I received the unit and turned on, the display was showing a code PR... I found out that the problem was a wire disconnected from the circuit board, thank God I am skilled in electronics and be able to fix the unit by my self! Didn't even mentioned that the frame that contains the circuit board was partially assembled showing on one side the a huge gap compared to the other side. Conclusion, in my opinion these products have never been tested before getting to the market, shame on you DeLonghi"", ""Love the unit!  It is what I needed.  Its inside oil is permanent - meaning, it never needs to be changed.  No oil smell - unlike the other oil based heaters.  It's getting hot in no time and it's doing the job!  Nice job whoever makes this product."", 'Very efficient and good looking heater.Easy to use and easy to roll on its wheels on any type of floor.', ""When i first got this heater the weather was still cool I set the tempt to 72 it warmed up very quickly and kept the upper part of my home very warm.  I have read other people's reviews on this item and by all means I do respect the opinion of other's the price at some place'es are way to high for this heater at best spending 50 dollars is a very good price if you can find cheaper then go for it.

EdenPURE A5095 Gen2 Pure Infrared Heater - Black Works Great No Remote L@@K,84.95, ,"[""This is a great heater. This is actually our 2nd one. We loved the 1st one so much that we decided to purchase another.  It does a good job of heating our living area. It doesn't seem to increase our electric bills by much. And it's much cheaper to use than heater fuel. I would recommend this heater for any one. "", 'Purchased this to supplement heat in my cold basement (I live in Michigan). It does the job for that quite well.  Not sure how the energy use will be as I have not been billed yet. I like that it is quiet.  I am using it to supplement the heat in an area that is considerably larger than what the heater should heat, but since it is a supplemental heat source, it works great maintaining a comfortable temperature in the entire area. The timer option is useful and the fact that it is thermostatically controlled (digital readout, so you know what the setting actually is) is good. It was a good investment for my purposes, as otherwise it would be difficult to spend much time in my basement workshop in the winter.', 'I have used this brand and model in my greenhouse for several years. The thermostat control protects my tender plants and turns off in the hot sun. I use this product from Mid-February through Mid-May.', 'I bought this heater not knowing what to expect, but it has done an excellent job. I ended up buying 2 and I am heating a 2400 square ft building with 2 of them. They run quiet, and are cool to the touch. I am really pleased with them.', ""My friend has the older version edenPure (same BTU) and it puts out a LOT of heat. The gen 2? Not so much... I bought the gen 2 based on the brand, and I'm not impressed at all. I think I would have been better off with a cheap ceramic heater for a lot less $."", ""I really like this heater. It is my second Eden Pure. It heats up my apartment so quickly and is so quiet.I love the size too. I have barely had to use it because Winter hasn't gotten here yet!"", 'It does an OK job of keeping the chill off, no where near as good as the last edenpure I had. It would warm you right up and lasted for many years. This one just does not have the same power that one did. But like I say when it is too warm for the CH and too chilly for nothing it does the job.', 'These are awesome heaters, I had one of the first ones when they came out, loved it, one of the good things about these heaters is that you can gets parts for them if ever you need them but I can say that it will be a long time before you will ever need to, I would recommend buying one.', 'This is a very efficient way to heat your home or office.

"9,000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Heater",84.97,Last item available,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‚Äò88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).
