Mr. Heater Buddy 9000 Btu/Hr. 225 Sq. Ft. Radiant Liquid Propane Portable Heater,106.33,21 sold,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

I love the timer and the option to set temperature down to the exact degree.  It's so quiet you don't notice it's running until you either get up real close, or you feel the warm air blowing.

Lasko Electric Portable Heater Thermostat Timer Digital Display Nonslip Base,107.81,30-day returns,"['The Lasko Cyclonic ceramic Heater is a great choice to heat a room.  Why?  well, here is what I think about my new heater.First, i was looking for a heater to use in my 160 Sq ft shop, that didn\'t take up a whole bunch of space. The Lasko heater is a good compact size, unlike Baseboard heaters that take up three to five or more feet of wall space, where you can\'t put things in front of them, this heater is only about 17"" wide.  Or my former oil radiator heater, that works well, but I had to pull it out from the wall to use it, as it gets hot all around it.This heater will heat a larger room, but I chose it because I wanted a fairly fast warm up, when I start to work.  I chose Electric because I don\'t want fumes or have to worry about getting Propane, or Kerosene.  I like the feel of the Electric heat.This heater has a thermostat that can be set, and a timer if you want it to go off by itself. Very Convenient !  It draws the cool air from the floor, and blows warm air out the top, from it\'s moveable ( up and down) exhaust.  The Fan forced air can travel most of the way across the room, which helps circulate the warmth evenly.The heater fan has two speeds so it\'s quiet enough to use in a bedroom if you want, and can be put right up against the wall so it\'s out of the way.I have used this in my shop for several days now, some as cold as 25 degrees outside, and this Lasko heater warms the shop up to a comfortable (for me) 68 deg. in about 30 minutes.Because it\'s only 25"" tall, the temperature the display on the front says, may need to be adjusted to your own likings, but I\'ve found once the whole room has warmed up the temp. displayed is within 2 degrees of the Thermometer I have on the other end of the room.So it does keep up with the set temperature when in thermostat mode fairly well. You can just have it on low heat or high heat all the time, but I like the convenience of the thermostat mode. It\'s simple to operate, and comes in several colors, to match your decor. While the housing is mostly Plastic, the Heater is sturdy enough. Because it is only 6.5"" deep, it stays tucked up tight ot the wall out of my way, and doesn\'t heat up the wall, like my oil/electric radiator did, but fear not if you tip it over, it has automatic shutoff.I don\'t have any complaints about this heater. I think it\'s just about perfect for small shops like mine, or a cold bedroom , or even to heat larger areas. Lasko made a good all around Electric heater here.', ""i've been using these for 7yrs now, after 4yrs took apart and cleaned them (i have 5) and even the 7yr old works as it did when new, i dont like to waste money so i have stuck with this model, i have the electronic version also (black)at another location, they are okay but not built the same inside, these seem to be better built, they do what they are designed to do, and i always use the ceiling fan to bring the heat down and mix it up so they dont run forever. i run 1 in each bedroom and two in the living room, not too loud, i know they are not a furnace, temperature at the grill is abt 200 degrees coming out so i use the ceiling fans on low or medium to help mix it up otherwise all the heat stays up at the ceiling. I feel this is the best heater in this class."", 'Nice heater that does a great job. Already own 6. Is an inexpensive way to heat house and safer as well.

Dyna-Glo 360 Degree Radiant Lp Tank Top Heater - 35000/30000 Btu,109.99, ,"['This heater is easily assembled (mounting bracket) and attaches quickly to the propane tank.  If using outside, the heat disbursement can be a narrow range around the setup due to not having a large reflector above the unit. That being said, it still works well when gathered around it.  If using within a ventilated enclosure, such as a garage, this heater when warm the area quickly and keep it that way.  I have yet to use a complete tank with the unit but have put a lot of hours on it.  It seems to not consume propane as fast as I thought it might.. which is a pleasant surprise.', 'This is quite a useful unit. The 360° heat output is perfect for chilly outside events and for use in case of a power outage as a back up, temporary source of heat. Although the burner itself is covered you would need to keep small children in away to avoid burns if touched.', ""Well, it was cold as heck at the last race event we had in Andalusia Alabama. I had to keep my truck running while I was there all day and sat in it between motos. I researched heaters from every avenue I could come up with. HF has a two head burner type that only points in one direction. Other resources sold the same 360 for what I'd consider too much expense. When I saw the price at an affordable cost via this ebay seller I jumped at it so fast I think Paypal felt the wind blowing. The shipping was faster that the ETA date which made it nice. Right now our weather reports conflict from one TV broadcast to the next. All I know is from what I read if it operates at all and I didn't buy a lemon then I feel like I am in luck. Needless to say I haven't used it yet. The weather report for this coming weekend 05 FEB 17 at GAMX in Andalusia doesn't have the temperature dropping to an uncomfortable low like our last event. I will still bring it because I have to be there before 7am so the temperature might be below 40 degrees. Which that might make me want to take it out of the box. One thing I am looking forward to is not having to stand by a bonfire and having the wind shift blow smoke in my face. I understand from what I read it could be possible to roast a mashmellow or cook a hotdog on a stick. But I think I am smart enough even though I live in the bottom of Alabama to step back from the heat at a comfortable distance. I did build a safety feature to hold the 20 lbs propane bottle upright using a stabilizer platform Lowes sold me attached to  a piece of plywood. I hope some person not paying attention doesn' t make a fool out of themselves or blow us all to smiterinez.

My ma and pa warned me about those kind of ladyz' and my giblets were rumbling with some sort of ovr pwerg  oh my lord what the heck am I writing"", ""the unit heats you at waist height so there no wasted fuel and the tip shut off is a great featureI'm going to buy a couple more they heat my hangar great"", ""I bought this heater for my un-insulated 14x24 foot shop. I've used a kerosene heater for years but when it really gets cold, it just doesn't cut it. I haven't used this Dyna-Glo a lot BUT  when you fire this up, it makes big heat RIGHT NOW! So far, the only drawback I see is that propane is a lot more expensive than kerosene. An $18 20lb bottle will last about 8 hours (I think) and the same time on my kerosene would cost about $5. I'll only use the propane when it's really cold. Bottom line is still....I'd recommend this heater."", 'The Dyna-Glo heater is the best gas heater i have ever owned. I use it to heat my garage when im gonna be out there working for any length of time. It heats my garage very fast. Before i would use my kerosene heater for this purpose and it would take around an hour whereas the Dyna-Glo only takes about 8 to 10 minutes. I tested them both at the same time the other day and the Dyna-Glo on the( low setting) was out heating the kerosene heater on high. This is a great heater, and without the strong kerosene smell. The Dyna-Glo is lightweight and very simple to use and burns very clean. Also has some great safety features and cools off fast after using. I may never use the kerosene heater again."" Sorry ole Friend "".', 'Works great, wish it had an electronic start or even push button, but other than that, love it', 'This heater works PERFECTLY! There\'s a ton of heat generated by this unit which totally and pleasantly surprised me. I use it in my garage for a small gathering of adult beverage consumers and it really kept us warm.

Mr Heater 4K - 9K BTU Portable Buddy Heater,107.2, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank.

Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.

It’ll keep me nice and toasty this winter since my steam radiator barely works in my apartment!  ', ""I bought this heater to use to warm a living room with vaulted ceilings. It has a cool LED flame effect that can be used alone or in conjunction with heat.  I find that the lowest setting is more than adequate for keeping the living room warm.

"Lasko 1500W Designer Series Ceramic Space Heater with Remote, 6435, Beige",106.99,30-day returns,"[""This is the 3rd purchase of the same heater.  1st for one of my sons, 2nd for my boss and 3rd to replace a noisy old heater at my desk.  Not only does it produce heat well but it is also is aesthetically pleasing in an office setting.  Those points combined with many levels of heat to chose from and a remote control feature to boot...perfection!!  Three purchases and each for less than $60...it's a winner!!"", ""The reason I wanted this heater was I needed supplemental heat to my daughters room which is the furthest from the central heating system and surrounded by three ouside walls. Have been using a small oscillating ceramic heater for a couple years, but not thermostat controlled. Love the Lasko, cause it heats room evenly and quickly! Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature. If you can run it on High which draws 12-14 Amps then it will work well for you! Why they disable temperature controlled operation in Low mode is baffling to me! ', 'This heater is a pretty good source of additional warmth where you need it. You may get tired of people asking you what it is though... It will not heat an entire home, but in my 22x28 living room, it does a pretty good job warming things up. Quiet and pretty. The remote works great, (even though it is almost as weird of a shape as the heater).', ""The heater is very dependable , I've had one for 1 year now. I have purchased two additional for other rooms. These units do the job of heating rooms well. They're very fashionable convenient."", 'first off gotta say this heater warms a medium size room very fast..and very wellalso easy to operate. only problem is the heater is very noise. looked over the reviewspeople said very quit very little sound NOT true loud fan and when oscillating is onmakes a verroom verroom sound [ best way to describe it]  gonna need to get out theear plugs gave it four stars for its heating', ""This little heater is great for taking the chill out of the air. My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me. (Don't rely on this heater being your main source of heat but rather as a supplement)."", ""expertbenefitsI haven't had it too long but it fits my purpose. I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable. It kind of cute too!"", 'I like the design of the heater very much and it certainly has enough output to heat what I intended it for.  I also like the features that it offers.  The only thing that I wish it did and it does not do is turn back on when the thermostat goes below what it is set at as well as turn off when it reaches the temperature.  All in all though, it is a good value and I have been pleased with it.', ""Granted it's not more than 1000 square feet, but this pretty little heater sits in the center of my house and keeps the whole house comfortable.  It has a thermostat,  (only 5 degree increments) but still will save me money by shutting off when the room is warm enough.  It has a convenient remote control.  First time I used it I smelled some electrical burning sent.  It only lasted a little while.

Dyna-Glo Propane Heater 18K BTU Auto Shut Off Radiant Steel Black,,30-day returns,"['A bit smelly at the beginning due that the paint is burning. Smell will go away in the 1st week. The front grill (chromed) will turn dark a bit but that’s to be expected. Enough heat for a 4x6m room when usign Liquid Propane gas. I used Butane and it was amazingly efficient (you feel the heat even with the pilot! Not even a single burner) but butane is difficult to find where i live.Comes with gas regulator, ready for a left internal thread. Easy to operate and very light to move around the house. Planning to buy another one for the 1st floor of the house. ', 'Amazing.  Really throws out a lot of heat.  Easy to set up, easy to use.  Cools off super fast too.  I use it on a front porch that has vinyl covers the open areas and open holes through the concrete base.  Maybe 100 square feet and on low it gets warm and toasty.  ', 'comes with wheels easy to install, and heat comes clean. tested with my CO (carbon monoxide) detector and is good for indoors. been using it on a rental property for couple days now. 3 settings for heat intensity. propane bottle doesnt go out as fast like other heaters.', ""This is a dyna-glo brand 6-18K BTU.3 burner panels knob controls 1,2,3 burner lighted.This would create 6,12,18k btu of heating output.Easy to setup with 20lb tank counter clockwise to tighten.Heats my 5-700 sq ft up to 70+ with 2 burners active in less /hr 50F ambient.Be safe with enclosed spaces with this, needs adequate ventilation.Have a carbon monoxide detector in airspace proximity.Doesn't produce much of a smell when burning, only during first few hours of being new."", ""this is my 3rd one, have one in my living room, one in family room. this one is just a backup. saw this advertised on five sights  3 said not for indoor use but others said that was just a disclaimer. i've used it indoors for 3 years with no problems.  i did disconnect the tipover device because it would not reset sometimes. great backup heating system"", ""This is a great heater. I have a 1500sq ft house that I heat with this heater and it will roast you out of the house. I usually run it on low and I put a little clamp on fan on top to push the heat out. The break in took awhile to burn off the new of it but after that there is no smell what so ever. It's easy to operate. I use it in the evening just to keep my electric bill down."", ""the buddy company makes one similar but this one makes the same heat it is a construction heater so not intended for use in your home(but that is just for the lawyers it is meant to heat a small area but one without clutter since items should be away from a 3 foot radius of 180 deg of the front the pilot lighting can be confusing for the stupid since you have to constantly hold down the pilot position for a few seconds then click the ignitor and leave it held down till the thermocouple heats which takes about 15 secondsso if you are a moron just buy an electric heateri heat my front room on setting 3 till it gets as warm as i like it  than outside then switch it to position 2 only complaints are the wheels don't roll well(yes i have the locking wheels unlocked)and the tank fitting is the old left hand  type instead of the easier to use new plastic (righty tighty)acme type that is on all propane tanks made after 1996also taking off and putting on the flimsy rear tank retainer is a bit annoying it would be better if it had a hinge and latch  instead of tabs and slots"", 'Needed something for back up heat due to our electricity being off frequently during storms and etc. This is an excellent source of quick and versatile heat. The ability to adjust from 6,000 to 18,000 BTUs makes it perfect. Build quality seems to be adequate. This is really a no brainer.', ""By every measure, this is wonderful heater. This heater quickly heats a 144 sqft room in 3-4 mins when using it at full capacity going from 40F to 70F. Excellent starting with the pilot light and it is easy to move (but the castors are probably not the greatest). At minimum capacity keeps an entire 2000sqft house from going below 62F when it is 22F outside (but this will also be dependent on air allowed in and insulation as well). Unlike electric, this gives off a pleasant infrared light that will heat things it is pointed at. This is quite nice since heated air is lighter than colder air and rises, but a chair or clothing 3-10ft away will warm from the light emissions. You can sit 3 ft away from it and warm your hands as if it was a camp fire from this light. You can also feel the hot air going straight up into the air.  Make sure you keep clear of the grill as in loose clothes or your leg. Also according to directions you are not suppose to leave it on unattended. But, one of the first things we did was roast marshmallows using long metal rods. For s'mores, you can get the perfect golden marshmallow. (even though it's not marketed as a marshmallow toaster).Between medium-to-high quality, portability, cost efficiency, and the shear fact that it paid for itself in less than one month from switching away from heating with electricity, I give it five stars.  "", 'We have heat pumps in our house and on those really cold nights they just don’t do the trick. We got this heater just for a little extra warmth and we have been shocked on how easy and warm it is. I found out that we only need to run it on low because medium and height is way to much.

Mr. Heater F232000 Portable Buddy Heater 4000 And 9000 BTU Hr Standard,108.72, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply.

"EH1-0020-25 VH2 Vortex Heater, 2 Speeds, Thermostat Control, Linen Color -",108.63, ,"[""I already own multiple Vornado products including a VH103 I purchased in 2011 that I'm still using to this day.What I liked the most is that it uses mechanical (not electronic) switches. You have 3 rocker switches with a main power switch, heat low/high setting and fan setting). You also have a dial to enable fan only mode (to use year round) or auto. You can use this with a remote or smart outlet (15A rating).What I don't like- somewhat hard to clean. In my experience, cleaning is not for the faint of heart. It is built exactly like the VH103 such that you have to unscrew the unit completely to separate the front and back, then I used a shopvac to blow out the dust from the heating coils and a cloth to wipe down the fan blade and clean out the grille. I've done this about every 3 years.Most critical difference between this VH2 and the older VH103:- When in heat mode, the fan in the VH2 will cycle on/off when in auto when the temperature is reached. In the VH103, the fan will continue running to maintain airflow and circulation- The temperature dial on the VH2 goes from 1-7 while the VH103 goes from approx 65 - 90 degrees. I found it much easier to dial in my setting when I could set it against a temperature. With the VH2, you need to figure out what dial setting works for you."", 'This heater warms up my room quickly and the thermostat feature works well to maintain desired temperature. Fan is a little noisy, but not horrible. I love that I can run the fan without heat to circulate air in my home especially when running an air purifier. Cream color fits well with my plaster walls. Auto-shutoff for tippage actually works! Would buy again, would recommend. ', ""Pros:- Fast and efficient with small rooms. This heats up a small room within 15 minutes on high (1500W) at setting 4. Once warm, it can be switched to low (750W) and turned down by 1 to maintain temperature.- Small. Doesn't take a lot of space and is easy to move around.Cons:- Noisy. Makes a notable but tolerable hum when operating.- Cannot set a temperature. Numbers are for adjusting the run time, but you must experiment. Set it too low and the room will cool faster than it gets heated.- Weak fan. Perfect for heating, but not for cooling a room during summer."", 'This is a great little portable heater for small spaces.I use it to heat a single room in the winter time vs heating up the wholehouse to warm up that room. Its relatively quiet and puts out a decent amountof heat vs several other portable heaters I tried out. I have only purchased them used due to the price of a new one buthave been quite pleased with its performance.', ""I purchased this heater to heat a bedroom but when I saw how much power it had, I used it to heat my whole loft. I am surprised that such a little unit could produce so much heat and I don't even have it on high. I'm very satisfied with this little heater and would definitely recommend it for small to large being needs."", 'I have tried a number of electric heaters to warm my finished basement.  Most of them do not last long or do not distribute the heat evenly.  So far this heater does a nice job and takes up very little room.  Time will tell if it can do the job over a long period, but so far so good.', ""I've been using this heater to keep my enclosed porch warm, we only have storm windows (ten of them) and they are not air tight as good windows would be.  This heater kept the porch around 58 degrees when the overnight temperature got down to twenty seven on a stormy windy night.  The heat is comfortable and even and the heater runs very quiet and is a stable unit.  I've been running it with the setting about half and on low almost continuously except if it warms up outside in the daytime then I turn it off.  The housing of the unit is also staying cool and I have cats on the porch who seem very happy with it and that's good enough for me.  However, haven't received my latest electric bill since I've been using it and I do expect it to go up, I'm just hoping it won't be too much."", 'A heater with a fan, what an idea ! ! !  Vornado makes terrific fan. Most space heaters make heat and if you sit over it you can get some heat from it. With the fan in this heater, this Whole Room Heater can raise the comfort level in a room by 20 degrees through out the room. Get it, you will LOVE it ! ! !', 'This heater definitely works better than other portable heaters I’ve used, but it smells like it’s burning. That said, it is cool to the touch, so it seems safe enough, just stinks. It warms my room about 5 degrees more than other space heaters I’ve tried, and I’ve tried several.', 'Love it! Arrived promptly, is like new. We have used these heaters before and they are great.  Also can be used as fan only to move cool air. Using it in RV right now.  Sure saves a lot of propane as supplement to central heat unit.  Great seller!  We loaned one of these to a neighbor in an RV park at Grand Canyon a few years ago, whose heating system went out in a remote area.

Lasko Electric Ceramic Portable Oscillating Space Heater 1500-Watt with Timer,109.23,30-day returns,"['The Lasko Cyclonic ceramic Heater is a great choice to heat a room.  Why?  well, here is what I think about my new heater.First, i was looking for a heater to use in my 160 Sq ft shop, that didn\'t take up a whole bunch of space. The Lasko heater is a good compact size, unlike Baseboard heaters that take up three to five or more feet of wall space, where you can\'t put things in front of them, this heater is only about 17"" wide.  Or my former oil radiator heater, that works well, but I had to pull it out from the wall to use it, as it gets hot all around it.This heater will heat a larger room, but I chose it because I wanted a fairly fast warm up, when I start to work.  I chose Electric because I don\'t want fumes or have to worry about getting Propane, or Kerosene.  I like the feel of the Electric heat.This heater has a thermostat that can be set, and a timer if you want it to go off by itself. Very Convenient !  It draws the cool air from the floor, and blows warm air out the top, from it\'s moveable ( up and down) exhaust.  The Fan forced air can travel most of the way across the room, which helps circulate the warmth evenly.The heater fan has two speeds so it\'s quiet enough to use in a bedroom if you want, and can be put right up against the wall so it\'s out of the way.I have used this in my shop for several days now, some as cold as 25 degrees outside, and this Lasko heater warms the shop up to a comfortable (for me) 68 deg. in about 30 minutes.Because it\'s only 25"" tall, the temperature the display on the front says, may need to be adjusted to your own likings, but I\'ve found once the whole room has warmed up the temp. displayed is within 2 degrees of the Thermometer I have on the other end of the room.So it does keep up with the set temperature when in thermostat mode fairly well. You can just have it on low heat or high heat all the time, but I like the convenience of the thermostat mode. It\'s simple to operate, and comes in several colors, to match your decor. While the housing is mostly Plastic, the Heater is sturdy enough. Because it is only 6.5"" deep, it stays tucked up tight ot the wall out of my way, and doesn\'t heat up the wall, like my oil/electric radiator did, but fear not if you tip it over, it has automatic shutoff.I don\'t have any complaints about this heater. I think it\'s just about perfect for small shops like mine, or a cold bedroom , or even to heat larger areas. Lasko made a good all around Electric heater here.', ""i've been using these for 7yrs now, after 4yrs took apart and cleaned them (i have 5) and even the 7yr old works as it did when new, i dont like to waste money so i have stuck with this model, i have the electronic version also (black)at another location, they are okay but not built the same inside, these seem to be better built, they do what they are designed to do, and i always use the ceiling fan to bring the heat down and mix it up so they dont run forever. i run 1 in each bedroom and two in the living room, not too loud, i know they are not a furnace, temperature at the grill is abt 200 degrees coming out so i use the ceiling fans on low or medium to help mix it up otherwise all the heat stays up at the ceiling.

PORTABLE HEATER 1500W SPACE PIVOTING Base Overheat Shutoff Adjustable Heavy,105.64,60-day returns,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs.

I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time.

Mr. Heater F242010 Golf Cart Heater - 4000 BTU,105.31, ,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!  More than pleased hubby here...........""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

World Marketing Of America DUREUH1500 120 V Heavy Duty Electric Forced Air He...,109.23,86 sold,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time. I put the heater in max mode and not matter what it just wasn't throwing out enough heat.You literally have to be right in front of the heater to feel anything. I wanted something affordable that was not powered by propane however they do say u get what you paid for."", ""I bought two of these for my garage and disregarded the previous reviews i read. The fan barely puts air out. It gets hot, but the fan almost seems like the motor is junk. I'll still use it. I'll just put a box fan behind it so it can actually move heat around."", ""The heater is built well and is safe however its useless in a garage or outdoors.

"Vornado MVH Vortex Heater with 3 Heat Settings, Adjustable Thermostat, Tip-Over ",106.52, ,"['I live in Nebraska and put the Vornado in a 25’x12’ ventless corner basement room with 4 windows. It works adequately for that room. It takes 10-15 minutes on the high setting to heat entire room so I can’t imagine ever using the low setting there. Maybe in a smaller room or camper or a warmer climate it would be needed. The Vornado is so quiet and the heating element hardly glows, that when first turned on I wasn’t sure it was working. It has a safety switch on the bottom and needs to be placed on a hard flat surface. It’s very compact and the plastic exterior makes it lightweight. That exterior though doesn’t seem real sturdy so I’ve got it up off the floor to avoid getting kicked or trod on. For the price and purpose I’m satisfied.', ""After searching for a year for a replacement for our beloved Braun heater we have finally found one that works well. The Vornado is not the design leader that the old Braun was but it does come close on one of the most important features for us. We use this heater in a quiet office environment, therefore the heater has to be quiet. We tried a popular Fasco, a Caframo that is styled after the Braun, and other brands. All were too noisy. The Vornado is not whisper silent like the Braun, but it come close. The noise level is about like a modern computer.Other features we like on the Vornado are the 3 heat settings, a fairly accurate thermostat and a decent length cord. The design is upright where the Braun was low. The vertical design with the large blade fan helps the Vornado more more air which helps warm up the room more quickly. It has a discrete small red led light that lets you know it's on. The heater is made in China.The downsides of this heater are minor. The heat range selector switch is not intuitive and dimly marked. You need to shine a light on it and maybe consult the manual to remember what the cryptic I, II, III markings mean. (I=low, II=med, III=high). And the case is shiny plastic which is a static electricity magnet. It attracts dust and animal hair easily. These are small issues. We normally leave the unit on one heat setting and it is under the desk, so pretty much out of sight. The black case helps it hide. Overall the heater looks to be well made and it's doing its job well. The price is a little high for a simple heater, but we are happy with it."", ""This is the third one of these I have bought. While it has a maximum of 1500 watts, these heat a room the most evenly of anything you can buy. It is quiet and you won't get burned like other heaters. "", ""This is my second Vornado fan I've purchased. My first one is still working perfectly but I never want to be without one and may use this second one when I travel.  I live in a rental suite that is chilly in Spring and Fall. Despite how benign this fan looks it produces a significant amount of heat.  I only start the day running this heater on the 1000 Watt (medium) setting and then turn down to low for the remainder of the day. It heats my open floor plan living room and dining room exceptionally well without driving up the electrical bill. Cheaper than running the furnace or my natural gas fireplace (altho come winter we use that in conjunction with the heater fan).  Bear in mind this is the most reliable model. Other models of heater fans by Vornado do not have the longevity of this one yet still cost as much or more. Read the reviews and choose this model for great value."", ""This little room heater is outstanding. I bought it for my daughter's bedroom is she's on the second floor and as we heat with wood sometimes your room cools down below normal during the winter. This little heater keeps her room nice and toasty I would recommend it"", 'Heats the bedroom up quickly.

It had to be taken apart and the base arms rotated 180 degree so the bracket would actually be behind the unit (like the picture shows).  Luckily, I am handy enough to do that.  The units work great but draw a lot of power.  At 1500 watts, a standard house breaker can only handle 2 (if you are lucky) with nothing else turned on. Running 3 units on the 750 watt setting is the best you can ask for.', 'Heater appears to be flimsy and cheaply made. That being said, it seems to work fine. But I have not used it a lot.  Makes me wonder how long it will continue to work.  But for the price, I can not complain. It does its job.  This is a very inexpensive heater.  It is important to have it pointed in the correct direction since it heats surfaces and I am the surface wanting to be heater. I would have liked it better if it could have been angled better, but it seems to have built in tilting restrictions.  The included LED light is cheap, very dim, and close to worthless.  But on the whole I am still happy.  Would I buy it again?  Depends on its longevity. If it lasts more than 3 years, yes.', 'It is well made, the price is a little excessive. It heats well, but only good for a small area. You can mount it several different ways, which is a plus.', ""I have used this type heater in my home shop for the last 15 years and it has done a great job. This past summer I built a 12' X 12' gazebo and I enclosed it for the winter so the kids can use it for a play house and still we cook in there with a electric grill. Since I have used this type heater for several years I decided to buy one for the gazebo and I am glad I did, it does a great job and it was a very good price."", 'Pros, heats well and radiates s good 10 feet plus,  two heat ranges 750 and 1500 watts, pull cord is perfect length for rafter mounting, power cord is long and high quality.    Cons, halogen light is bright and annoying but does not light up any significant space in the room, bracket system is ultra flimsy. Bracket assembly is ratcheted and only goes in one direction. You will break it unless your one in a million that reads bad language Chinese instructions, halogen bulb burns out frequently, are near impossible to find, and cost 8 dollars each. ', 'Really Gets the Heat Out! Ceiling Mount Using the Center Bolt ONLY, and You can Pivot and Swivel, to Aim the Heat at any Spot in a Cold Garage. The Heat Reaches Out 15+ Feet. I would Buy This Heater Again. Well Made, Safe, and Good Value. Highly Recommend.   ', 'Plugged in and all settings work.Chrome area around light is dented from what looks to be the assembly process.Shipping and package Box had no damage I could see.Light weight unit and even on low puts out, really good heat.Not pretty but nice space heater for off the floor unit.', ""I use my heater in my small garage ( 25' x 14' and no insulation) and while we haven't had any bitter cold weather yet, we have had a few nights in the 20 degree range.  My garage stays in the 50 degree range using both lamps."", 'I bought this heater as a supplemental source of heat in my converted step van. It did not maintain adequate heat. If you are looking to add some heat to your garage or workspace, it may be adequate, but as a heating source in a living area it is not sufficient. ', ""I am enjoying the pleasant heat from the pair of these heaters right now. along with 4 other that I previously balled out for a grand total of 6 of these mah's in my garage. Super baller with a built in light and 2 heat settings you cant go wrong. super compact in size yet able to keep a 2 car garage somewhat warm. would buy two more if my circuit breakers could handle em.

"Industrial Electric Heater, 1500-Watts",105.99,30-day returns,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time. I put the heater in max mode and not matter what it just wasn't throwing out enough heat.You literally have to be right in front of the heater to feel anything. I wanted something affordable that was not powered by propane however they do say u get what you paid for."", ""I bought two of these for my garage and disregarded the previous reviews i read. The fan barely puts air out. It gets hot, but the fan almost seems like the motor is junk. I'll still use it. I'll just put a box fan behind it so it can actually move heat around."", ""The heater is built well and is safe however its useless in a garage or outdoors. I would recommend it for use in a indoor room or basement environment where it doesn't have to compete with more harsh temperatures. Not exactly what I was hoping for!"", 'This looks good in the pictures, but is a terrible heater. The forced air is a joke. Plus it does not get hot. With the thermostat on high, after 15 minutes, I could still hold my hand about six inches in front of the grill. Very disappointed.', 'I thought I was going to buy this to upgrade the heater I use at work in the shop. I ended up just putting it in my car that I’m working on on the side of my house. It gets to about 80° inside just a car. I don’t expect it would be able to heat the shop. The fan is very weak as well.', 'It is good product for the price, it is slow on heating a large area but keeps it at a good temperature.', 'It came in a timely manner and works great as long as its pointed at you.

Electric Space Heater Tower 1500 Watt Portable Ceramic Oscillating With Remote,107.75,30-day returns,"['I purchased the Lasko 5397 oscillating heater for my mom several years ago +- 5 YEARS AGO. She uses it almost year round because she is always cold. She lives in San Fransisco and if you know anything about Mark Twain you know he said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in S.F. She called me and informed me that the  \t5397  was making funny noises and had a weird smell. I went over and discovered that it was shorting out. While in the off mode, the top of the unit was getting hotter than it does when it is in use. I took it out of the house and replaced it with the Lasko 5572. I purchased it only a few days ago but already I can tell she likes it even better. The 5397 comes on a pedestal stand. This one pivots at the floor. Because it pivots at the floor, the heat reaches down further on her legs thus she is happier. Don\'t be fooled by the photo, the heating element does NOT come all the way down to the floor but it does come down further then the previous oscillating heater. Both models work great and both have a remote control but this one edges out the other just by the fact that it has a ""longer"" heating element. I love the fact that even when on for 4 hours at the highest setting, if she accidentally bumps up against it or brushes up against it she won\'t burn herself like she would with one of those dish looking heaters. You can touch ANY PART of these ""Ceramic"" heaters (while they are operational and functioning) and NOT burn yourself.', 'I have used a wood furnace for 30 years, but now to old to handle the wood. I purchased the Lasko 5572 heater to see if I could use it to help heat my house. As I had 220 baseboard heaters installed knowing I must give up the wood heat. I was totally supprised with the Lasko heater, it not only helped the baseboard heater,it took the place of the 220 baseboard heater. I had origanly purchased one Lasko heater to try in one room. After the great job it did, I purchased three  more of them. I finished up the winter, heating with the Lasko heaters.  I would recommend them to anyone needing a heater. And If I have to replace any one of the heaters I have, it will be with a Lasko 5572 heater.HJ of Missouri', ""We were absolutely thrilled with the size and capability of this room heater.

One is #5165, the other one is #755320, the only complaint I have on this model is I had to stick a piece of foam tale on the top of the carrying slot in back so my finger wouldn't slip out of the carrying slot when carrying the heater.  The other heater's slot is angled so your fingers don't slip out.  The one remote does control either heater.  I recommended my satisfaction to a friend and he bought one and is happy with it.

In the day time, it is hard to see the setting due to the poor lighting on the temperature.', 'Excellent way to heat.  Cost effective.

Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit. The Oscillation can be Set by The Remote as well. PROS: Great Designed Unit.

"Lasko 755320 Ceramic Space Tower Heater, 8.5â€³L x 7.25â€³W x 23â€³H, Silver",108.45, ,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit. The Oscillation can be Set by The Remote as well. PROS: Great Designed Unit.

Vornado VH2 Heater,107.95,30-day returns,"[""I already own multiple Vornado products including a VH103 I purchased in 2011 that I'm still using to this day.What I liked the most is that it uses mechanical (not electronic) switches. You have 3 rocker switches with a main power switch, heat low/high setting and fan setting). You also have a dial to enable fan only mode (to use year round) or auto. You can use this with a remote or smart outlet (15A rating).What I don't like- somewhat hard to clean. In my experience, cleaning is not for the faint of heart. It is built exactly like the VH103 such that you have to unscrew the unit completely to separate the front and back, then I used a shopvac to blow out the dust from the heating coils and a cloth to wipe down the fan blade and clean out the grille. I've done this about every 3 years.Most critical difference between this VH2 and the older VH103:- When in heat mode, the fan in the VH2 will cycle on/off when in auto when the temperature is reached. In the VH103, the fan will continue running to maintain airflow and circulation- The temperature dial on the VH2 goes from 1-7 while the VH103 goes from approx 65 - 90 degrees. I found it much easier to dial in my setting when I could set it against a temperature. With the VH2, you need to figure out what dial setting works for you."", 'This heater warms up my room quickly and the thermostat feature works well to maintain desired temperature. Fan is a little noisy, but not horrible. I love that I can run the fan without heat to circulate air in my home especially when running an air purifier. Cream color fits well with my plaster walls. Auto-shutoff for tippage actually works! Would buy again, would recommend. ', ""Pros:- Fast and efficient with small rooms. This heats up a small room within 15 minutes on high (1500W) at setting 4. Once warm, it can be switched to low (750W) and turned down by 1 to maintain temperature.- Small. Doesn't take a lot of space and is easy to move around.Cons:- Noisy. Makes a notable but tolerable hum when operating.- Cannot set a temperature. Numbers are for adjusting the run time, but you must experiment. Set it too low and the room will cool faster than it gets heated.- Weak fan. Perfect for heating, but not for cooling a room during summer."", 'This is a great little portable heater for small spaces.I use it to heat a single room in the winter time vs heating up the wholehouse to warm up that room. Its relatively quiet and puts out a decent amountof heat vs several other portable heaters I tried out. I have only purchased them used due to the price of a new one buthave been quite pleased with its performance.', ""I purchased this heater to heat a bedroom but when I saw how much power it had, I used it to heat my whole loft. I am surprised that such a little unit could produce so much heat and I don't even have it on high. I'm very satisfied with this little heater and would definitely recommend it for small to large being needs."", 'I have tried a number of electric heaters to warm my finished basement.  Most of them do not last long or do not distribute the heat evenly.  So far this heater does a nice job and takes up very little room.  Time will tell if it can do the job over a long period, but so far so good.', ""I've been using this heater to keep my enclosed porch warm, we only have storm windows (ten of them) and they are not air tight as good windows would be.  This heater kept the porch around 58 degrees when the overnight temperature got down to twenty seven on a stormy windy night.  The heat is comfortable and even and the heater runs very quiet and is a stable unit.  I've been running it with the setting about half and on low almost continuously except if it warms up outside in the daytime then I turn it off.  The housing of the unit is also staying cool and I have cats on the porch who seem very happy with it and that's good enough for me.  However, haven't received my latest electric bill since I've been using it and I do expect it to go up, I'm just hoping it won't be too much."", 'A heater with a fan, what an idea ! ! !  Vornado makes terrific fan. Most space heaters make heat and if you sit over it you can get some heat from it. With the fan in this heater, this Whole Room Heater can raise the comfort level in a room by 20 degrees through out the room. Get it, you will LOVE it ! ! !', 'This heater definitely works better than other portable heaters I’ve used, but it smells like it’s burning. That said, it is cool to the touch, so it seems safe enough, just stinks. It warms my room about 5 degrees more than other space heaters I’ve tried, and I’ve tried several.', 'Love it! Arrived promptly, is like new. We have used these heaters before and they are great.  Also can be used as fan only to move cool air. Using it in RV right now.  Sure saves a lot of propane as supplement to central heat unit.  Great seller!  We loaned one of these to a neighbor in an RV park at Grand Canyon a few years ago, whose heating system went out in a remote area.  They said it saved their lives.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

It took no time to heat up a couple rooms of a little trailer, and the heater was only on low!  At that setting a tank of propane should last around 14hrs.

Even on high, a tank should last about 9.5hrs.  A good value!', ""I love this little gadget.

Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit.

Low Profile Fan Forced Ceiling Heater Enclosed Sheath Element Bathroom Kitchen,108.83,30-day returns,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation. The power to the heater tested good.', ""Love this little heater, just renivating my Mum's home.   It's so nice to have this little heater in the basement bath.  Very reasonable in price and a nice touch!!!"", 'Brand new unused, unopened.  Excellent purchase. ', 'The Broan 157 ceiling heater is a great upgrade from the "" twisted wire element "" heater. This unit has a solid element like on a stove top burner and heats my bathroom better.  You will be very happy with this unit.']","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.
