Allied Precision 742G Bucket Heater , , ,"['It does heat a bucket pretty good. Not in minutes, but in the course of several minutes. Wont heat up the bathtub hardly. Uses a lot of power. The product should put better labeling on it... Or at least in a manual. My brother burnt himself picking it up. Also, it fails to show how to properly immerse it. Is it supposed to stand up or can it float on its side? Is there a water level limit? Can the handle be submerged. The plastic part is the handle, right?', 'I wanted a bucket heater that keeps the water from freezing over in a livestock bucket.  The instructions that came with it said to not submerge this heater into a bucket or receptacle that cannot handle ""boiling water"".  It said the heater will maintain that temperature and the auto turn off valve will prevent the temperature from dropping too low to freeze.  So, I plugged it into a 5 gallon bucket of water and it heated up way too hot for any animal to want to drink it.  I then put it in a 25 gallon bucket and the same thing happened, although not boiling, was still too hot for any pasture animal to drink.  The box showed a horse on it and I can tell  you right now, none of my horses drink hot coffee, tea, OR plain water.  I have no idea what purpose this heater has and when I called to report it there was no one there at the time to help me and I was promised  call back to discuss the findings.  No call ever came.  I would like to return it but refuse to pay return shipping on such a ridiculous product.  I will shop elsewhere.SJH', 'This works well for small bodies of water.  It was in a 25 gallon water tank for 24 hours and was just warm.  The ambient temperature was 55 degrees.  I was thinking it would be at a boil way before that, after reading the description.  I guess it is only 1000 watts.  It will work well to maintain the temperature, it just takes a while to get there.', 'Heats 5 gallon bucket of water to low oil in under 30 minutes. Well made product. I would purchase again.', ""For the price this is a great product. I recommend hooking it up to a INK BIRD ITC-308 I believe it's called. It makes a great combo for reptiles or fish Very large fish tanks. "", 'So far i bought 2 of these.for the time that i had these, i really like them.only had a fee months but work great in 3 gallon buckets! 30 minutes  and water is hot.', 'I just put a little fountain water pump laying sideways in the pot I have it in, to circulate the water. It works perfectly.', 'Works perfect when I need hot  water at my shop. ', 'This unit really heats up the water. I added a water heater thermostat on the side of the bucket to keep the temps in the range I wanted. 120 deg F to 130 deg F.

Mr. Heater Brass Propane Tank Refill Adapter. Easily Refill Small Cylinders,19.99,19 watchers,"[""Easy to install by following the simple instructions on the package.  Makes filling the 1 lb canister simple and quick.  The instructions do warn the user to verify that there are no propane leaks (using soapy water) after a fill.  This is a MUST - I did have two leaky canister valves - and others were OK.  You may be able to stop the valve leak by a quick tap on the canister stem (helps to seal the canister's valve).  This is not a fault of the refill adapter - but simply a canister issue.     "", 'With the one pound propane tanks in the $3-4 range this is a real money saver.

"KEROSUN RADIANT 8,10,22 KEROSENE HEATER WICK, WICK BRUSH & WICK CLEANING GUIDE",18.59,101 sold,"['Considering purchasing a wick online for my 20+ year old kerosene heater left me with some doubt if the offered product would be a good fit like the original size. I decided to give it a try since the price was attractive and very competitive with what I could find in a store. When the wick arrived,i carefully opened the package and as I took the wick out, it felt thick and of good quality. After installing it,filing the tank and waiting half hour or so, I then lit the heater. After a few minutes I got a nice even glow demonstrating I got a good purchase!Be advised, it takes patience to make sure the new wick is even after you arrange it around the burner . Press the wick from the inside so it catches the little ""prickles"" that hold it in position before you try to slide it down . As you do this, keep your eye on the top of the wick to see that it remains even at the top of the burner before you slide the whole thing back into the heater.The wick was accurately sized as described for my heater!Additionally, the product arrived promptly.', 'Just what I needed and easy to install and works just fine.Put in the New one and got rid of the old. And everything is just fine and got. And got better heat without the smell.', ""I have not yet used the product as it is seasonal(winter) and even then, would be for emergencypurpose. I'm sure it will be fine."", 'It looks just like the old one and works great ', 'Quality product.Getting hard to find oem style wicks.', 'The wick seems to be well made', 'What I needed when I needed it', 'Works like new', 'Perfect product', ""It very good. I have had only one that seemed to work a little better. I don't remember what kind it was anymore since I have had the heater for many years now.

Mr. Heater Brass Propane Tank Refill Adapter ,19.99, ,"[""Easy to install by following the simple instructions on the package.  Makes filling the 1 lb canister simple and quick.  The instructions do warn the user to verify that there are no propane leaks (using soapy water) after a fill.  This is a MUST - I did have two leaky canister valves - and others were OK.  You may be able to stop the valve leak by a quick tap on the canister stem (helps to seal the canister's valve).  This is not a fault of the refill adapter - but simply a canister issue.

Handy Heater HEAT-MC12/4 Plug Outlet Speace Heater Tested,19.99, ,"['I purchased this heater for a very specific purpose. I needed a small heater to dry out a wood window sill for a window located in a bathroom shower (long story). This heater satisfied all of my requirements which included: small enough to fit in the space between the storm window and double hung window, generate enough heat to dry the space without over heating, have a thermostat, and operate continuously for a prolonged period of time. I have not had any problems operating this unit on a heavy duty extension cord (not recommended in instructions). This unit will automatically turn on and off as it reaches the temperature you set for the unit. It produces just enough heat to satisfy my need. Criticisms regarding the 12 hour time limit can be resolved by plugging this unit into a timer. When the power is shut off and then back on, the unit will run again for 12 hours intervals solving the problem of having to be present to restart the unit. This unit must be suspended to prevent blockage of the air intake located on the bottom of the heater.', ""Quality feels good, not cheap. Plug rotation feature is secure and not wobbly or junky at all. Heater pulls 297 watts when running, but pulls ~750 watts for about 30 seconds when you turn it on from cold. This is a powerful little heater, you would not want to put your hand directly in front of it for very long. Definitely enough to heat a very small space like a car, or heat up a small room which isn't quite warm enough. Has a thermostat which works well. The heater will run the fan for a bit and cycle down just as it should. It has a red LED which always stays on and give the impression of a hot surface so that you don't forget that the grill could still be hot.The heater sucks air in from the bottom where the fan is.Honestly, this thing has better construction and features than most space heaters I've owned.Cannot yet speak to reliability but based on the good circuit design it should last quite a long time."", 'We have an L shaped bath room and the  baseboard heater is on the long side. On cold days the far corner of the short side gets cold.  This gadget is perfect, set temperature and  shave in comfort. easy to use, takes no space. I saved about  $1200 by not adding another baseboard floor heater when  a $12 heater is perfect.  Kudos to the designer for a great product !!Ol George', 'I wanted this for a very small seedling starter greenhouse but will be unable to use it as it shuts off after 12 hours.  Also when you turn it back on it starts at 90 degrees.  You have to reset the temp and timer every time you turn it back on.  I also bought one for my daughter to use in her tack room for two barn cats but she is also disappointed because of the 12 hour turn off feature.  Only useful if you are there to turn it back on and reset every 12 hours.', 'While this thinks key feature is size, It works well.  Unfortunately the the other plug in a two receptacle outlet cannot be used while this is plugged in.  It blocks the free receptacle partially enough to render it non-usable. It does produce some small fast heat to a rathed general localized area. Is it worth $20.00?  Yes if you will use often, no if you dont require the convenience of it.  Cheaper and more effective heaters are available, its really based on the buyers preference and intended use.  Works great for heating up bathroom when done with showering.  I would reccomend this if you find yourself seeing it  be applicable in a scenario.  ', 'This is a great heater for a small area.I plan on using it for a walk in closet that seems to not get heated very well.I can turn this little guy on for five minutes or so and the problem is solved', 'Better than i expected because the plug works both ways into the outlet, this is good 4 me cause all my outlets are upside down &amp; heater has timer , &amp; low &amp; high..  compact &amp; small, low price i really thinks thats great.  Thx.', 'I love the fact that these heaters have a ground connection.  The third pole helps stabilize the heater in the socket and keeps it from leaning and possibly falling out, like the socket heaters with only two poles.  They are great for a small room like a bathroom. ', ""It is very small but it put out some nice heat for it's size.  I like the thermostat feature so it goes off when it gets to that temperature.  "", 'Iâve given 5 of these as gifts. They are perfect for a bathroom or office or reading area. They are powerful but only heat a small area. Buy using it in the morning by my chair while I read the paper or file paperwork I do not have to turn up my furnace. I can pre heat a bathroom when itâs below zero outside and avoid freezing the second I step out of the shower!Not intended to warm large rooms.

Comfort Zone CZ798BK Deluxe Milkhouse Utility Heater w Fan Black,18.95, ,"[""While the product appears to be well-made, the utterly anemic airflow from the under-powered 2-blade fan means that only things within about 2 3' are going to actually get warm anytime soon after turning this thing on, even at the highest setting.  As a fan, it is a complete joke. The much smaller heater that died and that this one replaced put out at least twice as much useful heat, moved a lot more air, and would project it a solid 6' or more!  This heater is nice-looking, sort-of, if you like louvers, but is functionally inferior relative to it's size and stated wattage.  Thankfully, the bathroom I bought it for is very small and it is almost enough to do the job of warming the room during a shower, even if it isn't up to the task of warming up any significantly-sized space or room, such as a bedroom, unless left to run for an hour or more. I will not be buying another one like this."", ""What can you expect from any heater?Heat and easy to use, PLUS GOOD PRICE.With that said, WHY would you buy a plasticCase heater. It it gets too hot? IT MELTS.So they really control output. With a metal case heater. They control QAULITY. Much much better heat output, made to last more than 1 year. This will be my 7 th metal heater in 20 years. The company that made them. Replaced 4 of them FREE AND SHIPPING.when you find something that's last,price,material made. You would to stick with it. RIGHT?.  With that said !!! I WILL NEVER BY A PLASTIC HEATER. !!!!!"", 'What a great little unit for a great little price. Love the ability to switch to low wattage. Easy on the generator heated the room quickly great quality', 'Control knobs are difficult to manipulate. Very tight so not recommended for anyone with arthritis. Other than that, this is a well designed and effective item. Would be much better if the knobs had some kind of wings or tabs on them.', ""I like this type of heater. They heat the house well. It's not cold enough yet to turn the pellet stove on so I use these and they keep the house at a comfortable temperature."", ""I use it as supplemental heat in an RV with thin walls. It does pretty well. It's not the most well built heater I've ever had and I had to tighten all the screws to keep it from being noisy (frequency of the fan made it vibrate a bit), but it heats well enough and the fan is pretty powerful.  It is louder than most though, but acceptable."", 'This heater works great.  Very quiet.  Very happy.  Highly recommend.', 'very good room heater, thermostat control for room comfort. it will actually keep 2 rooms warm, looks good operates easy keeps me warm.', 'i like that you can adjust between 1300 and 1500 watts and also has a adjustable thermostat. The fan is not very strong and wish it blew a little harder', 'Pro: Sturdy and puts out the heat. Con: Hard to dial in to one temp range. One morning I was cold and it stopped coming on. The thermostat dial is nearest the floor! You have to pick it up, press the button with your knee and adjust it.

"KEROSUN RADIANT 8,10,22 KEROSENE HEATER WICK & IGNITER *COMPLETE TUNEUP KIT PLUS",17.99,26 sold,"['Considering purchasing a wick online for my 20+ year old kerosene heater left me with some doubt if the offered product would be a good fit like the original size. I decided to give it a try since the price was attractive and very competitive with what I could find in a store. When the wick arrived,i carefully opened the package and as I took the wick out, it felt thick and of good quality. After installing it,filing the tank and waiting half hour or so, I then lit the heater. After a few minutes I got a nice even glow demonstrating I got a good purchase!Be advised, it takes patience to make sure the new wick is even after you arrange it around the burner . Press the wick from the inside so it catches the little ""prickles"" that hold it in position before you try to slide it down . As you do this, keep your eye on the top of the wick to see that it remains even at the top of the burner before you slide the whole thing back into the heater.The wick was accurately sized as described for my heater!Additionally, the product arrived promptly.', 'Just what I needed and easy to install and works just fine.Put in the New one and got rid of the old. And everything is just fine and got. And got better heat without the smell.', ""I have not yet used the product as it is seasonal(winter) and even then, would be for emergencypurpose. I'm sure it will be fine."", 'It looks just like the old one and works great ', 'Quality product.Getting hard to find oem style wicks.', 'The wick seems to be well made', 'What I needed when I needed it', 'Works like new', 'Perfect product', ""It very good.

Handy Heater HEAT-MC12/4 Plug Outlet Speace Heater,17.99, ,"['I purchased this heater for a very specific purpose. I needed a small heater to dry out a wood window sill for a window located in a bathroom shower (long story). This heater satisfied all of my requirements which included: small enough to fit in the space between the storm window and double hung window, generate enough heat to dry the space without over heating, have a thermostat, and operate continuously for a prolonged period of time. I have not had any problems operating this unit on a heavy duty extension cord (not recommended in instructions). This unit will automatically turn on and off as it reaches the temperature you set for the unit. It produces just enough heat to satisfy my need. Criticisms regarding the 12 hour time limit can be resolved by plugging this unit into a timer. When the power is shut off and then back on, the unit will run again for 12 hours intervals solving the problem of having to be present to restart the unit. This unit must be suspended to prevent blockage of the air intake located on the bottom of the heater.', ""Quality feels good, not cheap. Plug rotation feature is secure and not wobbly or junky at all. Heater pulls 297 watts when running, but pulls ~750 watts for about 30 seconds when you turn it on from cold. This is a powerful little heater, you would not want to put your hand directly in front of it for very long. Definitely enough to heat a very small space like a car, or heat up a small room which isn't quite warm enough. Has a thermostat which works well. The heater will run the fan for a bit and cycle down just as it should. It has a red LED which always stays on and give the impression of a hot surface so that you don't forget that the grill could still be hot.The heater sucks air in from the bottom where the fan is.Honestly, this thing has better construction and features than most space heaters I've owned.Cannot yet speak to reliability but based on the good circuit design it should last quite a long time."", 'We have an L shaped bath room and the  baseboard heater is on the long side. On cold days the far corner of the short side gets cold.  This gadget is perfect, set temperature and  shave in comfort. easy to use, takes no space. I saved about  $1200 by not adding another baseboard floor heater when  a $12 heater is perfect.  Kudos to the designer for a great product !!Ol George', 'I wanted this for a very small seedling starter greenhouse but will be unable to use it as it shuts off after 12 hours.  Also when you turn it back on it starts at 90 degrees.  You have to reset the temp and timer every time you turn it back on.  I also bought one for my daughter to use in her tack room for two barn cats but she is also disappointed because of the 12 hour turn off feature.  Only useful if you are there to turn it back on and reset every 12 hours.', 'While this thinks key feature is size, It works well.  Unfortunately the the other plug in a two receptacle outlet cannot be used while this is plugged in.  It blocks the free receptacle partially enough to render it non-usable. It does produce some small fast heat to a rathed general localized area. Is it worth $20.00?  Yes if you will use often, no if you dont require the convenience of it.  Cheaper and more effective heaters are available, its really based on the buyers preference and intended use.  Works great for heating up bathroom when done with showering.  I would reccomend this if you find yourself seeing it  be applicable in a scenario.  ', 'This is a great heater for a small area.I plan on using it for a walk in closet that seems to not get heated very well.I can turn this little guy on for five minutes or so and the problem is solved', 'Better than i expected because the plug works both ways into the outlet, this is good 4 me cause all my outlets are upside down &amp; heater has timer , &amp; low &amp; high..  compact &amp; small, low price i really thinks thats great.  Thx.', 'I love the fact that these heaters have a ground connection.  The third pole helps stabilize the heater in the socket and keeps it from leaning and possibly falling out, like the socket heaters with only two poles.  They are great for a small room like a bathroom. ', ""It is very small but it put out some nice heat for it's size.  I like the thermostat feature so it goes off when it gets to that temperature.

Vornado VH203 Personal Heater & Gold-Compact Cool Touch Electric 750w,20.0, ,"[""This item is functional as a fan but the heater settings are not very hot.  The only real advantage of this item is that the lower electricity usage keeps the cord &amp; electric plug from becoming dangerously hot and melting your electric outlet (like with other heaters  1000W).  Other than that I can't really say much else about this item.  Since my bed area is just an open space in the men's dorm of my recuperative care shelter I have no idea if these machines can really circulate the air in a small enclosedspace.  I am glad to have two of them though because my bed is right under a vent duct in the ceiling and with the AC over functioning I get a lot of cold air blowing on me at all hours.  But I'm basically sleeping with the heaters in my bed on high because of the weaker heat settings.
