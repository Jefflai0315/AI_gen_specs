Mr. Heater F215100 MH4B Little Buddy 3800-BTU Indoor-Safe Propane Heater,89.99,30-day returns,"['Even though it cost almost 1 1/2 One Pound Coleman tanks from 9pm to 5am,  it’s great. Keeps my whole RV toasty warm. I would recommend by a large propane tank to refill the 1 pound tanks. Much cheaper. But I’ve not been cold once. The safety feature of turning off it it tilts is great. Only problem I have found is the bottom piece you place on propane tank does not secure properly and falls off when lifted off the ground to move the heater. ', 'This little buddy heater is a fine unit for use in an ice fishing shelter or flip over sled / tent. It is the right size and has a small footprint.The angle of the head heating element is perfect for warming wet hands and can be easily aimed to direct the heater output.The only down side is that it can be difficult to light in even the slightest breeze.', ""This is just the right amount of heat and size  for my needs compared to the regular Mr. Heater but does not hold up to heavy use. Have had a regular size that I use in an icefishing house that has years of use on it. The little buddies I've had are lucky to make an ice season before getting had to light and the just quitting. Love the little buddies while they work but the regular Mr buddy is a much better long term value."", 'I bought this to heat my ice fishing hut and only used it a handful of times. Looks like it’s made pretty durable, the igniter works good, like the carry handle, the metal shield cools down pretty quick if you want to move spots. The negatives are the sensor for the automatic shut off is way too sensitive, if you dont have it pretty close to PERFECTLY flat it goes out which is a pain. Also there is no heat control so once it’s first lit it’s just barely staying lit, can’t have any wind blow on it or it goes out, plus once the honeycomb section is lit well finally and red it’s burning propane at such a low rate heat does not blow out of it, it only rises from it. I guess the plus to that is low propane consumption but it would be nice to be able to crank it up if you want to blow some heat at you. This is a new school version of a metal coffee can with a roll of toilet paper inside soaked in Isopropyl rubbing alcohol. ', ""These things do a good job of heating my small fish house, but it does not take long and they get hard to light and won't work Have gone through three in three ice fishing seasons.. The regular size Mr. Heater is more reliable and I should probably just stick with those but the smaller size and a bit less btu's just works better in my tiny and very well insulated fish house.Have tried the cleaning method described in the manual but it is very hard to take apart and nothing seems to help."", 'Bought 3 fir use to heat bedrooms in the house during power outages.  Just arrived and a week later a planned one day power outage.  With new born baby, needed to ensure both mom and baby would stay warm.  Used the heater and it was fine.  ', ""I have the larger Mr. Heater for our sailboat works great! So I bought this for our RTT roof top tent ..works good don't get as hot which is good for a tent ,But! the base that holds the 1lb tank should be twice the size feels like it could fall over .I plan on fabricating a larger base :)                                                                        -=CC=-"", ""Not cheap. It is tippy with the 1 lb cylinder. I asked Mr Heater for a parts list to hard pipe it directly to a 5 lb or 20 lb cylinder and I got parts list for using a hose. I don't want to use a hose. I like that it is quiet. I like that you don't need matches. I wish it had more than 1 heat output setting. It seems to be the best match available of heat output needed for my collapsible fish house."", ""I used this in my motorhome to keep the chill off at night and not have to use the furnace, which runs the batteries down significantly while boon-docking. It will run for 6 hours on one propane bottle, so it will not last all night. However, if you start it at midnight, it will run until 6 AM, at which time you can turn on your furnace for a short time if you're an early riser. Alternatively, if you don't want to run the furnace in order to save batteries, you could light the burners on your stove. Be sure to crack a window so as not to deplete all the oxygen.

1500W Ceramic Space Heater with Timer and Thermostat Large LED Display Black,85.99, ,"['My Lasko CC13700 was manufactured Feb 2019 Purchased 11/11/19 from a local store. This was made in China where forced labor is documented but Lasko’s Social Responsibility statement addresses that issue: “Lasko and its affiliates will not work with any suppliers that engage in human trafficking and/or slavery.” The CC13700 seemed like it had an unusually strong odor new out of the box while it was heating. The heat was great but using it with the odor in the living area brought some unpleasant upper respiratory irritation and potential health issues that go along with that. After it aired out during the first year, the odor was not as noticeable in a well-ventilated area. At the end of the second season, it began to shut off immediately after turning on. It was under warranty so I sent an email to customer service and got a helpful reply the same evening. The suggestion of blowing air into the unit from the outside was a temporary fix for a few months but the heater eventually stopped blowing heat again so I submitted a warranty request. Due to the Lasko heater breakdown, I bought a new baseboard-style heater (without the chemical odor) before getting the replacement. Lasko Consumer Services stood behind the 3 year warranty. CC13700 was on back order and not available so they offered a different model. I did not have to pay return shipping and received a replacement fan heater within 15 days. It’s great to have to have a new Lasko fan heater, but it reintroduces the same indoor air pollution so I’m using this one away from the bedroom and main living areas to give it a year to air out. Regarding the CC13700 magnetic field, I checked it with a Triaxial ELF Magnetic Field Meter and found that the magnetic field from the motor was almost 48” in all directions, so I kept that in mind to maintain some distance while the heater was in use. The closed design with easy-vacuum filter is a nice innovation compared with open design fan heaters. Weekly filter vacuuming was essential to keep the plastic case cool and AC plug prongs from getting too hot in the outlet. I wish I could give the CC13700 more than 2 stars because it was excellent at putting out heat but apparently it wasn’t built to last. I think a heater should work for 5 years to earn a 5 star rating but this stopped working in less than 2 years. Fortunately there was a 3 year warranty and Lasko handled the warranty replacement very well (but the replacement heater deserves separate review because it is a different product and model number.) If the CC13700 could be repaired and used again, I would be open to editing the review with a higher rating because it was great before it stopped working. This was powerful and it produced instant hot air: I set Automatic Temperature Control about 15 degrees lower than expected to get the desired level of heat. (CC13700 digital temperature at the floor reads lower than other thermometers that I have and since heat rises, it might take several hours to raise floor temperature one degree in a small room, even with the door shut, while temperature 5 feet above the heater may be 10-20 degrees higher than what is shown on the display.) At first I didn’t like the CC13700 because it has an ergonomic design flaw that took awhile to get used to, in which placing the fingers under the carry handle makes it feel like it might be easy to tip over or drop. Regarding the digital controls: Pressing the red On button starts the heater on Hi setting. The 2 left buttons activate Automatic Temperature Control with digital setting range from 39F-90F (which must be set with the heater turned on and running). After selecting temperature, the DIGITAL DISPLAY FLASHES SEVERAL TIMES. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DO ANYTHING ELSE AT THAT POINT. Wait for the display to return to indicate the current room temperature and the Automatic Temperature Control should be set.  Automatic Temperature Control seems to have 3 degree temperature window which raises the temperature 2 degrees above the thermostat setting and drops one degree below before resuming operation. AC power interruption resets digital features to factory default. Pressing the middle timer button reveals 9 settings to set the timer between 1-8 hours or continuous. Adjustable louver control for directional heat is a nice feature made possible by the closed design.', 'Ordered 2 heaters,Wanted to send them back because they were way  to small,but I deceived to try them and boy do they heat up,I got so worm I had to kick off the blankets in the middle of the night.For such a small heater they generate a lot of heat.', 'High temp trips my 20 amp breaker. works fine on low', 'heat my bathroom very well love it', 'This product heats the interior of a 36 foot Avion 5th wheel RV when the outside temperature is &gt;30 degrees F.

NEW Vornado IR400 Digital Dual Zone Infrared Heater Fan Portable Space 750/1500W,88.88,22 sold,"[""Compact lightweight but packs a heavyweight punch for a plugin in IR Heater aka the Amish heater etc. The Vornado design and fan really circulates it better than the more passive ones you find in store. So even at the same power on max this model warms a room way faster. If you want the ceramic style heater and such this is not for you.If you've done your homework and like IR heaters this one is a great value at $88 bucks, I have the IR 405 model from Vornado also. The difference is the control panel and color, the touch screen vs push buttons on this the 400. Honestly its not a big deal, the display auto times out on this model so power eco mode, lights back up when you press the temp up down or other buttons. If you like the touch feel control go with the IR 405. Having used all sorta space heater over years, this model pros safe/energy efficient, tip over feature works, and it works as a supplemental heat source in a good size space, the personal zone feature works. For an open concept space this may not feel enough, again that depends on your intent and this one is for a mid to large room. Close the door to the area and its toasty fast. So probably the best IR heater types from Vornado, for raising the temp up in a room. What else can I say it really works!"", 'It’s been around 70 days since we bought it, working great so far!Wonderful design, thick plastic(not cheap one), different mods,  bright screen, very compact and producing respectable amount of heat for the size.

Cozy Products FW Foot Warmer Mat Electric Rubber Personal Space Heater New 120 V,86.0,30-day returns,"[""In a Northern state, I've got an expensive office and the brilliant engineers designed a heating system with freezing cold floors. Not only that, constantly getting in and out of the car means inevitable snow on one's shoes in bad weather. This is a prescription for cold feet.This product is ideal for the job. Made of rubber so it's impervious to water or stains, cranks out the heat on high and trolls along beautiful on low. Plus, it's good size, bigger than the cheapie models so you don't have to think about where your feet are placed. Great value and highly recommended."", ""This rubber mat is excellent. I use it under my desk to keep my feet warm. It gets very hot. I believe around 135 degrees is what the mat heats up to. So this isn't some cheap mat that kinda gets warm.You can use it to warm your boots up also. The mat is injection molded one piece so it is water proof also. Would probably work great at the front door to melt snow or ice also."", ""Bought because our 70 yr. old house hardwood floors aren't insulated. This product is durable heats evenly perfect on cold nights to keep my feet warm in front of the tv. Did put down a piece of cardboard beneath the mat and floor as suggested by a previous purchaser's comment do not know if necessary. Have been using for weeks works great waterproof is a bonus, easy to keep clean.      arkansas"", 'The foot warmer arrived in a large, flat cardboard carton. Its switch (from high to low wattage and off) works well. This is the second one I have bought, both not for my feet but for my outdoor dogs/cats. Though it was not guaranteed for pets it works well in dog houses when the temperature is at 10 degrees F. Since it is sturdy for standing on with work shoes it also is tough enough for cats and dogs to sleep on. I put a special wrap on the AC wire to it to prevent animals from damaging the cord and usually use it at the low wattage setting. It is much more sturdy than the electric pet pads that are being sold.', 'My significant other has an office area just outside of our main house, the floor is cold and so were her feet until we put one of these mats under her desk and another by her photo tent.  Now her feet are warm and she is happy, so am I.  The wide range of heat settings and heavy construction make this a good purchase.', ""It's perfect!!!We live in Wisconsin with cold winter day's and night's. Hot water heat in our home so under the table gets real chilly because of having tile flooring.This unit is great because its warm enough to feel, yet not so warm you need to keep turning it on and off.I was also happy to see it had a lighted on/off switch about in the middle of the cord.If your legs ever get cool or cold under a desk or table, buy this unit!!!I wish I had it years ago and saved on the electric bill for the small heater I was using."", 'I repair watches my semi finished basement and I  have struggled trying to keep my feet and legs warm as my bench is against an outside wall. Have had an unheated rubber pad on the floor and it helped somewhat but this electric pad is great, l can actually sit in comfort even without shoes or extra pairs of socks.  Actually warms the air space for my legs too! Only used it for a few weeks but I am very impressed. Hope it lasts a long time.', ""It's a little hot for my feet in socks so I just folded up a bath floor towel into 1/4's and it's perfect in my basement office during the winter. I also use it with a Woods 50030 Indoor Countdown Timer so I never have to worry about leaving it on. Great product."", 'Take your shoes off and enjoy this foot pad on the coldest of days!!! Nice! And it has a handy on/off switch half way up the cord!!', ""I bought two of these foot warmers. One in March and one in May 2021.March purchased died in aprx September.May purchased survived till March 2022.Both were once placed under the table and never moved, so it's not a miss-use or broken cable. We always switched them off after several hours of use.Make your own judgment if it's acceptable. I don't think so.On the bright side - when it works it, well, works, keeping your feet warm.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Dura Heat Electric Forced Air Heater 5120 BTU- EUH1500,86.99,30-day returns,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time. I put the heater in max mode and not matter what it just wasn't throwing out enough heat.You literally have to be right in front of the heater to feel anything. I wanted something affordable that was not powered by propane however they do say u get what you paid for."", ""I bought two of these for my garage and disregarded the previous reviews i read. The fan barely puts air out. It gets hot, but the fan almost seems like the motor is junk. I'll still use it. I'll just put a box fan behind it so it can actually move heat around."", ""The heater is built well and is safe however its useless in a garage or outdoors. I would recommend it for use in a indoor room or basement environment where it doesn't have to compete with more harsh temperatures. Not exactly what I was hoping for!"", 'This looks good in the pictures, but is a terrible heater. The forced air is a joke. Plus it does not get hot. With the thermostat on high, after 15 minutes, I could still hold my hand about six inches in front of the grill. Very disappointed.', 'I thought I was going to buy this to upgrade the heater I use at work in the shop. I ended up just putting it in my car that I’m working on on the side of my house. It gets to about 80° inside just a car. I don’t expect it would be able to heat the shop. The fan is very weak as well.', 'It is good product for the price, it is slow on heating a large area but keeps it at a good temperature.', 'It came in a timely manner and works great as long as its pointed at you.

Maybe in a smaller room or camper or a warmer climate it would be needed. The Vornado is so quiet and the heating element hardly glows, that when first turned on I wasn’t sure it was working. It has a safety switch on the bottom and needs to be placed on a hard flat surface. It’s very compact and the plastic exterior makes it lightweight. That exterior though doesn’t seem real sturdy so I’ve got it up off the floor to avoid getting kicked or trod on. For the price and purpose I’m satisfied.', ""After searching for a year for a replacement for our beloved Braun heater we have finally found one that works well. The Vornado is not the design leader that the old Braun was but it does come close on one of the most important features for us. We use this heater in a quiet office environment, therefore the heater has to be quiet. We tried a popular Fasco, a Caframo that is styled after the Braun, and other brands. All were too noisy. The Vornado is not whisper silent like the Braun, but it come close. The noise level is about like a modern computer.Other features we like on the Vornado are the 3 heat settings, a fairly accurate thermostat and a decent length cord. The design is upright where the Braun was low. The vertical design with the large blade fan helps the Vornado more more air which helps warm up the room more quickly. It has a discrete small red led light that lets you know it's on. The heater is made in China.The downsides of this heater are minor. The heat range selector switch is not intuitive and dimly marked. You need to shine a light on it and maybe consult the manual to remember what the cryptic I, II, III markings mean. (I=low, II=med, III=high). And the case is shiny plastic which is a static electricity magnet. It attracts dust and animal hair easily. These are small issues. We normally leave the unit on one heat setting and it is under the desk, so pretty much out of sight. The black case helps it hide. Overall the heater looks to be well made and it's doing its job well. The price is a little high for a simple heater, but we are happy with it."", ""This is the third one of these I have bought. While it has a maximum of 1500 watts, these heat a room the most evenly of anything you can buy. It is quiet and you won't get burned like other heaters. "", ""This is my second Vornado fan I've purchased. My first one is still working perfectly but I never want to be without one and may use this second one when I travel.  I live in a rental suite that is chilly in Spring and Fall. Despite how benign this fan looks it produces a significant amount of heat.  I only start the day running this heater on the 1000 Watt (medium) setting and then turn down to low for the remainder of the day. It heats my open floor plan living room and dining room exceptionally well without driving up the electrical bill. Cheaper than running the furnace or my natural gas fireplace (altho come winter we use that in conjunction with the heater fan).  Bear in mind this is the most reliable model. Other models of heater fans by Vornado do not have the longevity of this one yet still cost as much or more. Read the reviews and choose this model for great value."", ""This little room heater is outstanding. I bought it for my daughter's bedroom is she's on the second floor and as we heat with wood sometimes your room cools down below normal during the winter. This little heater keeps her room nice and toasty I would recommend it"", 'Heats the bedroom up quickly. Like the thermostat settings to keep room at even temp.', 'Compact size  heats a room in no time at all   I love it', 'Compact size', 'Quiet efficient small size unit=Love it', 'Vornado heaters are the only ones that I use, as they are dependable, quiet, and safe!  This one is the quietest one I have ever had and, like all Vornado heaters, warms my bedroom in about 2 minutes.

1500-Watt Portable Electric Space Heater Pivoting Base,86.46,Last item available,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.

Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time.

Lasko Designer Series Oscillating Ceramic Heater with Remote Control - 6435,86.0,5 watchers,"[""This is the 3rd purchase of the same heater.  1st for one of my sons, 2nd for my boss and 3rd to replace a noisy old heater at my desk.  Not only does it produce heat well but it is also is aesthetically pleasing in an office setting.  Those points combined with many levels of heat to chose from and a remote control feature to boot...perfection!!  Three purchases and each for less than $60...it's a winner!!"", ""The reason I wanted this heater was I needed supplemental heat to my daughters room which is the furthest from the central heating system and surrounded by three ouside walls. Have been using a small oscillating ceramic heater for a couple years, but not thermostat controlled. Love the Lasko, cause it heats room evenly and quickly! Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature. If you can run it on High which draws 12-14 Amps then it will work well for you! Why they disable temperature controlled operation in Low mode is baffling to me! ', 'This heater is a pretty good source of additional warmth where you need it. You may get tired of people asking you what it is though... It will not heat an entire home, but in my 22x28 living room, it does a pretty good job warming things up. Quiet and pretty. The remote works great, (even though it is almost as weird of a shape as the heater).', ""The heater is very dependable , I've had one for 1 year now. I have purchased two additional for other rooms. These units do the job of heating rooms well. They're very fashionable convenient."", 'first off gotta say this heater warms a medium size room very fast..and very wellalso easy to operate. only problem is the heater is very noise. looked over the reviewspeople said very quit very little sound NOT true loud fan and when oscillating is onmakes a verroom verroom sound [ best way to describe it]  gonna need to get out theear plugs gave it four stars for its heating', ""This little heater is great for taking the chill out of the air. My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me. (Don't rely on this heater being your main source of heat but rather as a supplement)."", ""expertbenefitsI haven't had it too long but it fits my purpose. I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable. It kind of cute too!"", 'I like the design of the heater very much and it certainly has enough output to heat what I intended it for.  I also like the features that it offers.  The only thing that I wish it did and it does not do is turn back on when the thermostat goes below what it is set at as well as turn off when it reaches the temperature.  All in all though, it is a good value and I have been pleased with it.', ""Granted it's not more than 1000 square feet, but this pretty little heater sits in the center of my house and keeps the whole house comfortable.  It has a thermostat,  (only 5 degree increments) but still will save me money by shutting off when the room is warm enough.  It has a convenient remote control.

Lasko Electric Ceramic Portable Heater 1500-Watt with Digital Display Thermostat,89.32,30-day returns,"['These fine units provide heat to a room. The one I have used for  five years is still going strong, I think it is a quality product and would recommend.', ""This room heater was a great price and came with good reviews. It's sleek looking, stylish in appearance but I bought it for a 300sq ft room and it doesn't heat the space.  It's best used in a closed room (not open great room area) and best guess 14x14. The air is very hot and the heater cool to the touch (great around small children), but I am disappointed that it doesn't heat more area than it does. By comparison, I have another space heater that is supposed to heat up to 1500sq - and it does it well.  --Hope this helps. "", ""Blows good heat, but thermostat doesn't shut off and the the tip over function also does not work.

Vornado 1500-Watt 120-Volt VH2 Whole Room Electric Space Heater EH1-0020-25 VH2,86.43,30-day returns,"[""I already own multiple Vornado products including a VH103 I purchased in 2011 that I'm still using to this day.What I liked the most is that it uses mechanical (not electronic) switches. You have 3 rocker switches with a main power switch, heat low/high setting and fan setting). You also have a dial to enable fan only mode (to use year round) or auto. You can use this with a remote or smart outlet (15A rating).What I don't like- somewhat hard to clean. In my experience, cleaning is not for the faint of heart. It is built exactly like the VH103 such that you have to unscrew the unit completely to separate the front and back, then I used a shopvac to blow out the dust from the heating coils and a cloth to wipe down the fan blade and clean out the grille. I've done this about every 3 years.Most critical difference between this VH2 and the older VH103:- When in heat mode, the fan in the VH2 will cycle on/off when in auto when the temperature is reached. In the VH103, the fan will continue running to maintain airflow and circulation- The temperature dial on the VH2 goes from 1-7 while the VH103 goes from approx 65 - 90 degrees. I found it much easier to dial in my setting when I could set it against a temperature. With the VH2, you need to figure out what dial setting works for you."", 'This heater warms up my room quickly and the thermostat feature works well to maintain desired temperature. Fan is a little noisy, but not horrible. I love that I can run the fan without heat to circulate air in my home especially when running an air purifier. Cream color fits well with my plaster walls. Auto-shutoff for tippage actually works! Would buy again, would recommend. ', ""Pros:- Fast and efficient with small rooms. This heats up a small room within 15 minutes on high (1500W) at setting 4. Once warm, it can be switched to low (750W) and turned down by 1 to maintain temperature.- Small. Doesn't take a lot of space and is easy to move around.Cons:- Noisy. Makes a notable but tolerable hum when operating.- Cannot set a temperature. Numbers are for adjusting the run time, but you must experiment. Set it too low and the room will cool faster than it gets heated.- Weak fan. Perfect for heating, but not for cooling a room during summer."", 'This is a great little portable heater for small spaces.I use it to heat a single room in the winter time vs heating up the wholehouse to warm up that room. Its relatively quiet and puts out a decent amountof heat vs several other portable heaters I tried out. I have only purchased them used due to the price of a new one buthave been quite pleased with its performance.', ""I purchased this heater to heat a bedroom but when I saw how much power it had, I used it to heat my whole loft. I am surprised that such a little unit could produce so much heat and I don't even have it on high. I'm very satisfied with this little heater and would definitely recommend it for small to large being needs."", 'I have tried a number of electric heaters to warm my finished basement.  Most of them do not last long or do not distribute the heat evenly.  So far this heater does a nice job and takes up very little room.  Time will tell if it can do the job over a long period, but so far so good.', ""I've been using this heater to keep my enclosed porch warm, we only have storm windows (ten of them) and they are not air tight as good windows would be.  This heater kept the porch around 58 degrees when the overnight temperature got down to twenty seven on a stormy windy night.  The heat is comfortable and even and the heater runs very quiet and is a stable unit.  I've been running it with the setting about half and on low almost continuously except if it warms up outside in the daytime then I turn it off.  The housing of the unit is also staying cool and I have cats on the porch who seem very happy with it and that's good enough for me.  However, haven't received my latest electric bill since I've been using it and I do expect it to go up, I'm just hoping it won't be too much."", 'A heater with a fan, what an idea ! ! !  Vornado makes terrific fan. Most space heaters make heat and if you sit over it you can get some heat from it. With the fan in this heater, this Whole Room Heater can raise the comfort level in a room by 20 degrees through out the room. Get it, you will LOVE it ! ! !', 'This heater definitely works better than other portable heaters I’ve used, but it smells like it’s burning. That said, it is cool to the touch, so it seems safe enough, just stinks. It warms my room about 5 degrees more than other space heaters I’ve tried, and I’ve tried several.', 'Love it! Arrived promptly, is like new. We have used these heaters before and they are great.  Also can be used as fan only to move cool air. Using it in RV right now.  Sure saves a lot of propane as supplement to central heat unit.  Great seller!  We loaned one of these to a neighbor in an RV park at Grand Canyon a few years ago, whose heating system went out in a remote area.  They said it saved their lives.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Lasko Products 5397 30 in. Digital Crmc Pdstl Heater,88.83, ,"[""I've had several Lasko heaters, but especially like the pedestal ones.  I currently have one very similar which is 10 years old &amp; still going after heavy use.  It did make a strange noise recently &amp; decided to buy another one just in case it might be wearing out.  However, haven't heard the noise again.  This is an updated model of my old one."", ""Overall this is a good little heater. It has a small footprint and it will warm a small-medium size room in about 15-20 minutes.  The ability of the unit to oscillate and the fact that it has remote control makes this about as convenient as it gets. Lots of good features and controls. Only caution is to make sure that you don't have two of these units plug into outlets that are on the same breaker.  If you do the breaker has to be at least 20amps. Anything less will trip the breaker on high draw when the heaters are warming the room. This is definitely more efficient than powering up to central heater for the whole house."", 'My last lasko heater lasted 7 years and was used a lot. I love the design of the new one. Hopefully it lasts as long as my first one. This one is quieter with a remote👍', 'This works well in heating our family room.  Saves heating the whole house.  I especially like remote control and ability to adjust to different temps.  Takes up little space and turns like a fan so covers a wide area.', 'We bought this for my son in laws man cave and he loves it. He turns it on and 10 minutes later can stay in his man cave all night long! Considering its been in the single digits, its an awesome heater and at a very good price!', ""i needed to heat a small room it works great but they don't give you the required screws to put it together.  I had screws at the house that worked.  i could imagine how this would make some people mad tho"", ""Here in NW Florida, it gets cold enough for a heater. To save money I dont cut on my main heat. It's a heat pump. Heat pumps dont provide much heat and they cost a lot to run. I have two of these lasko tower heaters. They provide all the heat I need  and keep my electric bill manageable."", 'I bought  2 of these for supplemental heat . I love the thermostat and the timer .

"Mr. Heater UTV/Golf Cart Portable Propane Heater, 4,000 BTU",89.99, ,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

Tower Space Heater Ceramic 23inch Oscillating Quiet Zone Portable Electric 1500w,87.61, ,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit. The Oscillation can be Set by The Remote as well. PROS: Great Designed Unit.

Lasko CD08200 Small Portable Ceramic Space Heater for Bathroom and Indoor Hom...,88.74, ,"[""I put this bathroom heater in my bedroom to compare with another good Lasko room heater of similar size and the same 1500 W but with different features. I like the angle of the heat blast from this bathroom heater better for when I'm sitting on my bed getting dressed in front of the heater, I am happier with the other in my office. which has a steeper angle of blast and a thermostat.I also use this bathroom heater in the bathroom for which it was intended. I wanted it above the sink level for safety, as there's nowhere else to put the heater but on the sink counter.  I  turned a fire safe small ceramic square kleenex holder upside down, and the heater's feet fit nicelyinside.This bathroom heater is convenient because of the one press button for a preset one hour of high heat for quick warmups such as in the bathroom or when getting dressed. No fussing with buttons. It also has High and Low settings that run without a timer.I also noticed that some sellers were saying their heaters were OK for the bathroom but the actual manufacturer did not.  This Bathroom heater is designed for the bathroom.  I'm not sure if the tripper in the cord is necessary if the outlet has one too, as many houses do these days in any water environment such as the bathroom or the kitchen.  I'm guessing the tripper in the plug reacts to the unit rather than the wall socket."", ""This heater does an excellent job of putting out a lot of air with the fan and also Heats the room excellently. For my application I'm using it in a fifth wheel trailer bathroom which is fairly small but one of the problems I'm having with the heater is I'm using a different thermostat on it that is more accurate to turn on and off and the heater shuts off and doesn't come back on when I use the thermostat on it so what you need to do is put something on the round button on top of the heater and tape it down to hold the button down all the time so that thermostat that I've got set up works properly and we'll kick the heater on when the temperature drops or more so when I want to heat the bathroom during a certain time of the day like when I take a shower.Otherwise the heater is an excellent heater and I would highly recommend anybody to buy it very good quality."", 'The heater is modern in design. It has a one hour feature that I love. I turn it on , shower get dressed in a warm bathroom, never have to wonder if I left it running. It automatically shuts off after 1 hour.', ""1. easy to turn on and off2. heats up fast3. has 1-hour auto shutoff4. very sturdy design, not likely to tip over5. made for humid areas like bathroomsbonus: it's cute!"", ""Here's the story:  To have my small bathroom warm when I get up in the morning for my shower, I had a small ceramic 1500 Watt heater connected into a wall timer to turn on automatically, and if I forgot (which I often did) to turn off automatically. With this Lasko heater, I tap the top when I'm ready to shower and it turns on high for one hour. Firstly, I don't have to remember to turn it off. Secondly, the velocity of the hot air coming out is so high that the bathroom heats up much quicker than my other heater, even though the wattage of both units is the same. This saves my electric bill.It seems to be good, quality wise, but it's only a month old now so we'll see.  November, 2020A note:  After it's turned off, and the top button (the big and only one) is tapped, it starts at the timed one hour 1500 Watt setting automatically."", ""It is difficult to find a space heater that is specifically for bathroom use. I was happy to find this one at this price and good reviews! It does exactly what I need it to do, I warm up my bathroom before a shower as my heat does not do that well - North side of house in Wisconsin! I will see how it holds up this winter, but so far very pleased with it's performance."", 'Works great! Instant heat . Small size is great. Comes with wet location plug  &amp; cord', ""Perfect replacement for my old heater that finally died. Small, lightweight, gets super warm in my little bathroom. Like that it's specifically made to use in a bathroom. Warming, the front grill can get hot!"", 'This little heater has all the power i need to heat up the bathroom in a hurry. Set it for an hour walk away and it turns itself off. Very nice 👍 made for humid bathroom areas. Very attractive too.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

The unit has a short 6 ft cord with explicit instructions to only plug direct to wall outlet - no extension cord or surge protector.  We were able to pull the unit to 3-4 ft of our seats but could not feel any head.The room has HVAC, we were simply trying to augment the furnace by having a heater close.  We could tell no difference in comfort wether the unit was on or off.Support is low level.  I called the 800# and was told the unit only works in a room with a thermostat.  Laughable.  Called back and spoke to 2nd person who said that was incorrect."", ""I don't like a hot room, this heater is just right, warms up the room to the degree u want, remote easy to use.

The blower and heating elements are in the top 1/3 of the  unit, the rest is just waisted space. I feel like Duraflame made this model for big box stores to look like an expensive unit. It works fairly well at putting out heat, but doesn’t feel much like infrared though. It can heat a 300 sq ft loft (gas heat set at 60) up to around 70 degrees without running constantly.
