"Comfort Zone 7,500 Watt 240V Digital Fan Ceiling Mount Heater w/ Remote CZ230ER",175.0,321 sold,"[""This replaced a 40 y/o unit that worked, but not well. Having the remote control makes temperature control much easier. The high mode provides instant heat when used and the guide vanes direct the flow well. I did replace the circuit breaker as this unit has a max draw of 31.4 amps (7500 watts)on high mode, and insured the wiring and connections were proper. It's below freezing outside and this unit cycles and maintains 63-68 degrees with a 72 degree setting. The area is an insulated 900 sqft and the temperature is read on the wall furthest from the unit. Until I get a better primary heat source this is a great unit to have till then."", ""The heater is built pretty tough, which is a good thing. I also found it easy to connect, which interestingly enough was more expensive for the materials than it was for the heater. Only problem is that it doesn't heat as well as advertised. It claimed to heat an area (uninsulated) that was 30x30. my garage is 25x35 so I figured that was basically the same thing. after running for an hour or more it only brought the temp up from 45* to about 52*. I guess that if I left it running all the time it would eventually gey there, but that was not what I was hoping for. Plus, those temps were only for the emediate area around the heater, the far end of the garage was still ice cold. In any account it is a good heater for the price. especially if you already have a place wired for it."", ""Havent used it yet, but looks nice. It's smaller than I thought but as long as it heats good then I'm ok with it. I was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the plug. Luckily I have an extra one. I will have it hooked up in a couple of days. Thanks. "", ""Installed in my 2 car garage, used the correct 8ga wire and double pole breaker. On high setting, it trips the breaker. Tried a different breaker, no luck. It doesn't heat the garage as well as I anticipated, but better than having no heater at all. I like the remote, it works well. Heater is quiet. Not impressed but whatever. I may end up moving it to my basement, where I believe it may work better. "", 'After researching different heater I found this to be the best deal, but the heat sensor is on the inside witch makes it shut off sooner than it should so I located it on the outside and it now works good. I also looked on youtube to see how to hook up 220w and found it to be really easy but make sure you use 8/3 wire and a 40amp double pull breaker for safety reasons. I have a 24x30 insulated garage with 8 foot ceilings and at 32 degrees it will heat up at about 10 degrees an hour and after a while when the heat is up a little bit it seems to heat up faster so I use my kerosene heater to speed things up a little and when it gets around 68 degrees this heater can maintain very easy. now just so you know I have 4 metal cars in my garage that retain cold air for quite a while so your garage might heat up faster depending what you have in it', ""I purchased this unit to replace my old one. The unit arrived very quickly. I think it took 4 days to get to me. Packaging was very stout, no damage to the unit. I did have a friend of mine help me install it but it wasn't really hard and could have done it in a pinch. Instructions were easy to read. I have a 25x25 sq ft shop, insulated to about R4 and this heater does a nice job of warming it with outside temps around around 32F. This unit is also nice in that I have a choice of hi or lo elements used to heat.I would recommend this and install it myself if I go to a larger building."", 'Great price, great size, easy to use', ""Not happy with this heater. First of all, the thermostat is not correct, as it is located INSIDE the heater where it stays hot. Must be set much much higher for desired temp. Second, and worst of all, when the heater switches ON or OFF, it makes a extremely loud BANG. Really disappointing for the price and would return it if it wasn't hard wired in. Regret buying the warranty, as I don't plan on keeping past it's first breakdown."", 'The temperature sensor is mounted in a way that the heater cuts off way before room temperature is reached.  Believe the sensor is getting reading from the case rather than ambient temperature.  ', 'Well Made. Easy to use. Shipping was fast, with damage. Easy to install. Easy to hang. Would highly recommend it if the square footage is right and it is insulated.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr. Heater MH9BX Indoor Portable Propane Heater Deluxe Kit,,459 sold,"[""I have been hunting working outside and in the elements for the last 25 years. I particularly use this brand and model for most of my outdoor activities when the need for heat rises. This product is one of the best and only ones that I carried for hunting ice fishing and other activities period lightweight excellent instruction dependable and reliable on a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 9.5. Only for the fact nothing is ever truly perfect. But if I've ever had an issue with one it was sent back one was replaced or fixed with no problems or issues I highly recommend this unit for anyone looking for a portable way to keep warm on the go outdoors in the elements."", ""I haven't actually tried it on a camping trip yet but I am confident that this will be sufficient to safely take the chill off my conversion van so I am to catch a few hours nap when traveling without running the gas engine to keep warm. It's very easy to use but be patient after installing the LP gas bottle. You will have to hold the button starer for 30-60 second to purge the fuel line of air before the gas actually starts flowing to the burner. Once purged it starts very quickly!"", 'It is a wonderful product.  It is very simple to operate and has an attractive design.  It burns very cleanly with only a faint smell of propane.  Even on the low setting, it warms a 300-ft. area very quickly.  I do not yet know how long a one-pound container of Propane will burn.   It also has a convenient carrying case that holds the heater unit and two one-pound bottles of Propane.  That makes it easy to store, and it takes up very little space. I give it five stars (out of a possible five).  We had an ice storm in Oklahoma last year that knocked out power for over a week; my little apartment was freezing.  With Mr. Heater in the closet, I feel safe and secure for the next power outage.', ""Well first of all I started out as a Coleman heater man and I didn't think no other propane heater brand could outdo the Coleman product but Mr heater portable buddy does with greater heat output. The only thing that Mr heater could improve on is a way to regulate the heat temperature. It's just low 4000 btu to high 9000 btu and that can get to hot in a small area. Other than that so far, I find it to be a very good propane heater. Won't be going back to Coleman. For one thing their heaters wear out fast."", ""i really like this heater,this is the second one i bought.. the first one is still working fine..i'm writing this review based on that one. it has worked flawlessly. i use it all the time on the boat, all winter..it's a 34 foot boat with a large cabin that i use all winter.10 mins and the chill is gone. in 30 mins we're opening coats and relaxing..a 1 lb tank lasts all night on high..have taken it camping this year.. kept us warm &amp; cozy.the downloaded pdf instruction manual says it's safe for indoor use..but there still a CO2 warning..as with any other fire producing device..haven't had any problems at all with it...although i did have to clean a spider web from the pilot light in the fall.. i took the entire thing apart jut to see how it works.. very simple to work on..and i checked on line for any replacement parts.. all of the parts are available and fairly cheap.that makes it totally fixable..the safety features work almost too well.. a bump and it shuts off.. never had the tip over safety needed, but it has been checked.new in the store for 95$.. bought it used for 65/w shipping.."", ""If you are considering to buy a portable gas heater, so it's the one you have been looking for. It's very safe, light, has posibility to connect to big tank and looks solid.It has few safety off switches: turn over, flame out and low oxygen (this one I wasn't able to find in any other device) so this means that you can use it almost anywhere. It is very light and it came with carycase with wich it is even more comfartable to have it with you. It use not that much propane compared to how much heat it gives. It has two working modes High an Low. so far I have noticed that it uses about 100 grams (3.5 ounces) per hour in High mode and I think that it might use more than twice in low mode. It gives sufient heat to heat a room of 140 feet. And if it is not enaugh for you it has it's biger version with twice more power.Though it gives a bit of odor, but it is not that much noticible.So as I said, if you are looking for portable gas heater it is the one."", ""I bought this heater to take along tent camping when I go to different hunting places throughout the state. The heater seems to be very dependable. It is easy to start and to stop. I have used other Mr. Heater brand heaters for several years and they hold up well. The size is correct for my needs and heats my space easily. The 1 pound bottle attaches easily and is removed easily. It's a great little heater. It is a bit larger than I expected, but that does not effect how I will use it."", ""The Buddy Heater is an excellent idea with some flaws. I use mine nearly every day of winter. A ceramic heater is perfect for indoor use. You don't have to worry about carbon monoxide gas, and if you crack a window, the oxygen won't deplete. I love my heater! However, the Buddy Heater is not engineered well. All gas and propane are saturated with a very stinky oil which smells like rotten eggs so you will recognize it when you smell it. The Buddy Heater's small tubing, which delivers the gas to the the pilot light and ceramic heater, will condense out this oil in cold weather. When the tube fills with oil to a certain point, oil will get to the pilot orifice tube; this tube has a special glass filled hole that meters the pilot flame. Once that clogs -no pilot flame. No pilot flame, no worky. Mr Heater will sell you another pilot and ignition set, but this does not address the oil sitting in the tube. It will clog even faster. I have tried to call them to encourage them to change the design, but they just ignore me. My solution, and it works, is to carefully take the back off, remove the pilot assembly, unscrew the pilot orifice and put a pipe cleaner through the supply line. I then take pliers and put the orifice piece over a torch flame and heat it until it is smoking; hot enough to burn out the oil. I put it back together and it will work for another 2 months, (everyday use) before it clogs again. I  tried buying their in-line filter, but it still clogs up. The oil molecules are small enough to get past the filter. So I recommend the heater, but it's a real hassle when it stops working on a cold night!"", ""Excellent for portability and heating. Easy to use and simple to clean.  The downside of portable heaters it the short heating time.. 3 hours on full... up to 8 hours on ... thrifty usage.  Let alone the high cost of propane items now.For a permanent long time use I recommend the Olympian series heaters for durability.. all metal. The buddy heaters are excellent tho with excellent components and durability.Don't drop em tho.. the thermocouple moves a bit and it'll shut off all the time if you do not know where to move it back to."", 'I already had a good experience with the Mr Heater MH9B since my dad had purchased 3 of these a few years ago for our various hunting shacks. Very pleased with the updated design making the lighting of the heater easier with the pilot ignitor built into the adjustment knob and the swivel connector for the propane tank is a nice feature. Did an excellent job heating my hunting blind and also the area in my garage where we processed our deer. Would strongly recommend this heater to anyone.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

NEW Comfort Zone Industrial Ceiling Mount Heater 5000 Watts 240V Garage Electric,176.0,126 sold,"[""easy install, seems to be made well.  love the three heat settingsall parts were present and was packaged well. upon install, turned on power, turned thermostat knob and bam...had instant heat as I had expected...bring on the cold!!.however, one feature that I wish it had was a delayed fan off to cool the heating coils after use. when you rotate the thermostat knob, the fan shuts down immediately, leaving the hot coils to cool off too slowly. also, the unit I received didn't have a visible mark on the thermostat knob for easy identification of position (easily fixed). overall, nice product for the money"", ""So much easier than installing a gas furnace and vent.  Fan creates a full circular heat draft all the way around my 20x20 detached garage.  Heats up quickly and I can then turn it down.  Thermostat works well.  I had a 30 amp welder plug in a good location, so mounted it on the ceiling and used a 10' dryer plug cord.  Quick and easy installation.  Should have done this years ago.  No more freezing with a little space heater."", 'I recommend knowledgäble HVAC guy to add the external thermostat if you need one.  I have high ceilings and wanted to use my mouting system that âttaches to the walls in a corner - no ceiling holes, but two nights of engineering the aluminum mounts.  Hester has been set on low since I installed it and let the Honeywell electronic thermostât do the work.  Waiting for ã heating bill to begin tuning it for optimãl settings depending on weather.  But garage can get hot it works so well.', ""I purchased this heater to use in a 666 sq ft, 4-car, uninsulated, vaulted ceiling garage.  Obviously this is meant to be used in a smaller, more insulated setting.  I wanted to try just one first, and then add as necessary.The heater itself seems to be well-built as far as structure, and designed well as far as installation and operation.  Including running wiring and building a wall mount (vaulted ceiling so no ceiling studs), it took 2-3hrs to get up and running.In my large uninsulated setting, over the course of 3-4hrs, it was able to raise the temperature from 25*F to 45*F, roughly speaking.  In other words, from intolerable to tolerable.  Which is about what I expected from it.  I think it would do quite well at maintaining a higher temperature if I were to use my propane 'salamander' to initially heat the space.Based on other's reviews and my own experience, there seems to be a major quality control concern in the assembly line for these regarding the fan nut.  I was unaware of this until after it was installed, but I'm almost certain I have the same issue as almost everyone else.  Before mounting the heater there was a nut and washer rattling around inside.  After a semi-thorough check, I figured it was an erroneous leftover.  Having read the reviews and after hearing a small rattle when the heater runs, I will be dismounting and tearing it down to install that nut properly.  This is both an inconvenience and really a potential danger.  For that I've removed a star from the rating.That being said, I will be purchasing another one, possibly two more.  Can't beat the price to performance ratio anywhere.Edit from the future:  I bought another one, slightly updated since the first.  This one had no problems and even runs quieter.  Awesome."", ""This heater does a great job heating my 24'x30' insulated shop. I have it on a Honeywell line thermostat, and typically keep it at 40* to keep water lines from freezing, but when I'm ready to work in the ship I just turn it up and in 20 minutes it's nice and toasty. The other day it was 30* outside, but on high this ran for less than 5 minutes every 20-30 minutes.The only potential negative to be aware of is that it has a slight whistle when it's running. It's enough that I think about it every time it starts up, but it's not enough to be a nuisance.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase; it was easy to install, and is cost-effective for the job I needed it to do."", ""Fast shipping.Well packaged.All metal construction.Enough detail in instructions,easily installed,best of all:heater works great.No issues so far.I heat a decent size 2 car garage and this is all I need.Recomend a ceiling fan to force the heat down,same thing with all of 'em.I can not stand beneath this heater when it is on high,it is way beyond my expectations.It is not very big or impressive,but do not let that part fool ya,it is a good heater.I have left the thermostat inside the heater,so far this is working fine."", 'I have used 4 times now and I really like it. If you have a insulated two car garage this heater will do the job nicely.It only took about 30 minutes to go from 30° to  62° in an hour it was 71° had to turn it down to work though. I like it 57° to 63° when working on a project. This heater is perfect for my needs. Little less than $100 too!👍', ""I'm happy with this heater and wish I'd found it years ago. I installed it in my basement workshop and it is way better than the big baseboard heater and kerosene heater I'd been using for many years. It's quiet and easy to install and heats the basement better than I'd anticipated. The workmanship and quality are great and I especially like that the sheet metal parts are post painted as opposed to crummy pre-paint and so all the sheet metal cut edges and corners are painted and nice and smooth and burr free."", 'I use this heater turned down low just to knock the edge off the cold so I can work comfortably in my 3 car garage shop.  I have it set on about 1/3 of its capacity and it keeps the garage at about 55- 60, the way I like it.  If I were to turn it up on high it would make the garage toasty warm.  The installation was straight forward and simple.  I bought a plug, 15 ft. of 10-3 service cord and a cord grip to make the installation. I plug it into my 220 volt welder receptacle when I want to have heat.  Wish I had found it years ago.', 'Great heat output, replaced my floor oil heater and small plug in with this one.  Only reason I gave it a 4 not 5 is that # 1 the fan blade was loose when I got it and the simple mechanism makes a rattling noise that is not necessary.  It only has a moving fan part but is kinda noisy.  Heats very well.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr. Heater Portable Big Buddy Propane Heater,179.99,Last item available,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Gas Heater Mr. Heater MH12HB Hunting Buddy Portable Propane 6000 to 12000 BTU,180.0, ,"[""we finally got to use our mr. buddy heater while camping in our pop up tent this past weekend. waking up around 4 or 5 in the morning with the temperature about 45 degrees....that's a little chilly for us desert dwellers. mr. buddy takes the chill off in just a few minutes. the small, green portable propane tanks do get a bit frosty after about 45 minutes and if they are almost empty the unit just stops. I'm not sure if the unit stopping is due to the oxygen sensor or the bottled propane tank chilling because I used a partially filled bottle first, assumed it was empty, but found it still had liquid in it. after a few minutes I reinstalled it and started right up and ran until it was empty. we did have ample ventilation as the old pop up is not so tight and also we had the vent cracked a little. we experienced no headaches or notice of any lack of oxygen. all in all we really like it and recommend this to anyone. even on the low setting this unit does the trick. we found our large propane tank was empty when we got there so we did not get to use with the hose. the built in fan does work but we didn't use it this time. on a scale of 1 to 10 I give this item an automatic 20!

No more freezing with a little space heater."", 'I recommend knowledgäble HVAC guy to add the external thermostat if you need one.  I have high ceilings and wanted to use my mouting system that âttaches to the walls in a corner - no ceiling holes, but two nights of engineering the aluminum mounts.  Hester has been set on low since I installed it and let the Honeywell electronic thermostât do the work.  Waiting for ã heating bill to begin tuning it for optimãl settings depending on weather.  But garage can get hot it works so well.', ""I purchased this heater to use in a 666 sq ft, 4-car, uninsulated, vaulted ceiling garage.  Obviously this is meant to be used in a smaller, more insulated setting.  I wanted to try just one first, and then add as necessary.The heater itself seems to be well-built as far as structure, and designed well as far as installation and operation.  Including running wiring and building a wall mount (vaulted ceiling so no ceiling studs), it took 2-3hrs to get up and running.In my large uninsulated setting, over the course of 3-4hrs, it was able to raise the temperature from 25*F to 45*F, roughly speaking.  In other words, from intolerable to tolerable.  Which is about what I expected from it.  I think it would do quite well at maintaining a higher temperature if I were to use my propane 'salamander' to initially heat the space.Based on other's reviews and my own experience, there seems to be a major quality control concern in the assembly line for these regarding the fan nut.  I was unaware of this until after it was installed, but I'm almost certain I have the same issue as almost everyone else.  Before mounting the heater there was a nut and washer rattling around inside.  After a semi-thorough check, I figured it was an erroneous leftover.  Having read the reviews and after hearing a small rattle when the heater runs, I will be dismounting and tearing it down to install that nut properly.  This is both an inconvenience and really a potential danger.  For that I've removed a star from the rating.That being said, I will be purchasing another one, possibly two more.  Can't beat the price to performance ratio anywhere.Edit from the future:  I bought another one, slightly updated since the first.  This one had no problems and even runs quieter.  Awesome."", ""This heater does a great job heating my 24'x30' insulated shop. I have it on a Honeywell line thermostat, and typically keep it at 40* to keep water lines from freezing, but when I'm ready to work in the ship I just turn it up and in 20 minutes it's nice and toasty. The other day it was 30* outside, but on high this ran for less than 5 minutes every 20-30 minutes.The only potential negative to be aware of is that it has a slight whistle when it's running. It's enough that I think about it every time it starts up, but it's not enough to be a nuisance.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase; it was easy to install, and is cost-effective for the job I needed it to do."", ""Fast shipping.Well packaged.All metal construction.Enough detail in instructions,easily installed,best of all:heater works great.No issues so far.I heat a decent size 2 car garage and this is all I need.Recomend a ceiling fan to force the heat down,same thing with all of 'em.I can not stand beneath this heater when it is on high,it is way beyond my expectations.It is not very big or impressive,but do not let that part fool ya,it is a good heater.I have left the thermostat inside the heater,so far this is working fine."", 'I have used 4 times now and I really like it. If you have a insulated two car garage this heater will do the job nicely.It only took about 30 minutes to go from 30° to  62° in an hour it was 71° had to turn it down to work though. I like it 57° to 63° when working on a project. This heater is perfect for my needs. Little less than $100 too!👍', ""I'm happy with this heater and wish I'd found it years ago. I installed it in my basement workshop and it is way better than the big baseboard heater and kerosene heater I'd been using for many years. It's quiet and easy to install and heats the basement better than I'd anticipated. The workmanship and quality are great and I especially like that the sheet metal parts are post painted as opposed to crummy pre-paint and so all the sheet metal cut edges and corners are painted and nice and smooth and burr free."", 'I use this heater turned down low just to knock the edge off the cold so I can work comfortably in my 3 car garage shop.  I have it set on about 1/3 of its capacity and it keeps the garage at about 55- 60, the way I like it.  If I were to turn it up on high it would make the garage toasty warm.  The installation was straight forward and simple.  I bought a plug, 15 ft. of 10-3 service cord and a cord grip to make the installation. I plug it into my 220 volt welder receptacle when I want to have heat.  Wish I had found it years ago.', 'Great heat output, replaced my floor oil heater and small plug in with this one.  Only reason I gave it a 4 not 5 is that # 1 the fan blade was loose when I got it and the simple mechanism makes a rattling noise that is not necessary.  It only has a moving fan part but is kinda noisy.  Heats very well.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

I considered the small propane table top heaters but my wife nixed that idea.  The typical outdoor 8 foot high propane heaters would have probably have drawn to much oxygen from the 13\' X 20\' sun room.  As I searched for other heating options, I came across this heater that stored a 20 lb. tank and made it look aesthetically pleasing.  It provides the right amount of heat for various atmospheric conditions!', 'We use the heater to supplement our fuel oil furnace. Works great to give a shot of heat while maintaining an overall lower temperature while we are gone', 'We got the heater shortly before Christmas 2017 here in Texas. Same day it arrived we had a freeze. Heater was installed in a converted barn and temp got up to about 75 in 15min or so. We have been using it for about a week now in below freezing temps with no issues other than it takes a few clicks to get the pilot to light. With all 3 burners going I pointed my temp gun at the front. My gun only goes to 1,000 deg and the heater is over that.', ""Great heater for my garage/workshop.  The heater puts out enough heat to warm up my 24' x x24' garage on a cold winters day (in Michigan).  With it's 3 settings (Lo, Med &amp; Hi) I start on Hi to raise the temp, then I set it to Lo to maintain temp.  I like the idea that the LP tank is built into the heater (instead of a separate tank and extension hose).  It makes the heater easy to roll around the shop and set it where the heat is needed.  I've had no issues with it not starting or operating properly.All in all, this is one great little portable heater.  I'd definitely but it again."", 'It is exactly what we needed.

"Dr Infrared Heater DR-122 Bedbug Heater with Thermometer and Timer, Big, Black",180.0, ,"[""The unit was easy to assemble and we had it quickly up and running in 20 minutes. The quality of components and hardware is good and the instructions were easy to follow. The deciding factor in purchasing this unit was that it ran off of one 110v outlet. Other units that we looked at required multiple circuits (one required 4).In regard to negative feedback, it is nominal but the S clips that hold the center racks in place are very loose and it would be nice if Dr. Infrared would design them a little bit more rigid. The temp gauge/meter is of good quality but you need to understand that the timer counts back and not forward as to how long the unit has been on.We deal with bed bugs daily at our men's homeless shelter and it is so nice to take their belongings and quickly bake the little buggers out in under two hours. We are seriously thinking about getting a couple more tents in the near future."", ""Although I am grateful for a solution that doesn't cost thousands of dollars I have three complaints about this bed bug heater:1. The instructions are cursory, especially given how concerned most users will be to do things correctly, and the diagrams for assembly are faint. A link to a video would be great.2. The hooks to hold the shelves on WILL NOT fit in half the holes pre-drilled in the poles. And I mean WILL NOT with the force of two adults twisting and grunting in awkward physical positions. The holes are simply inadequately made. Note that I did get the other half in, so it is not that I cannot figure out how to do it, although a better diagram and an explanation would have helped see complaint #1.3. It takes HOURS to heat up to 120F and it's a really hot summer here! Would have been nice to know that. See #1.A minor disappointment is that the timer has no presets. A huge design bonus would be if the thermometre-timer could shut off the heater at the appropriate time. One really has to monitor over a period of hours, and can't using it overnight."", 'Does the job well, easy set up. You can put so much inside and price was cheaper than most.', 'TOOK SOME TIME TO FIGURE OUT THE SEQUENCE TO PUT TOGETHER.

It was a 1500 watt model, but after installing the Com-Pak, that was only 1000 watts, it's output was higher. And it's construction was obviously of high higher quality.  And it is much quieter than old was, even when it was new. Only problem I had was it was slightly smaller to fit into the original hole in the wall.  Not the fault of the heater.

"Mr. Heater Portable Propane Buddy Heater MH 9BX 4,000-9000 BTU Indoor Safe",180.0,30-day returns,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply.

Comfort Zone CZ220  5000  Watts Fan-Forced Ceiling Mount Heater 240 V,176.0,80 sold,"[""easy install, seems to be made well.  love the three heat settingsall parts were present and was packaged well. upon install, turned on power, turned thermostat knob and bam...had instant heat as I had expected...bring on the cold!!.however, one feature that I wish it had was a delayed fan off to cool the heating coils after use. when you rotate the thermostat knob, the fan shuts down immediately, leaving the hot coils to cool off too slowly. also, the unit I received didn't have a visible mark on the thermostat knob for easy identification of position (easily fixed). overall, nice product for the money"", ""So much easier than installing a gas furnace and vent.  Fan creates a full circular heat draft all the way around my 20x20 detached garage.  Heats up quickly and I can then turn it down.  Thermostat works well.  I had a 30 amp welder plug in a good location, so mounted it on the ceiling and used a 10' dryer plug cord.  Quick and easy installation.  Should have done this years ago.  No more freezing with a little space heater."", 'I recommend knowledgäble HVAC guy to add the external thermostat if you need one.  I have high ceilings and wanted to use my mouting system that âttaches to the walls in a corner - no ceiling holes, but two nights of engineering the aluminum mounts.  Hester has been set on low since I installed it and let the Honeywell electronic thermostât do the work.  Waiting for ã heating bill to begin tuning it for optimãl settings depending on weather.  But garage can get hot it works so well.', ""I purchased this heater to use in a 666 sq ft, 4-car, uninsulated, vaulted ceiling garage.  Obviously this is meant to be used in a smaller, more insulated setting.  I wanted to try just one first, and then add as necessary.The heater itself seems to be well-built as far as structure, and designed well as far as installation and operation.  Including running wiring and building a wall mount (vaulted ceiling so no ceiling studs), it took 2-3hrs to get up and running.In my large uninsulated setting, over the course of 3-4hrs, it was able to raise the temperature from 25*F to 45*F, roughly speaking.  In other words, from intolerable to tolerable.  Which is about what I expected from it.  I think it would do quite well at maintaining a higher temperature if I were to use my propane 'salamander' to initially heat the space.Based on other's reviews and my own experience, there seems to be a major quality control concern in the assembly line for these regarding the fan nut.  I was unaware of this until after it was installed, but I'm almost certain I have the same issue as almost everyone else.  Before mounting the heater there was a nut and washer rattling around inside.  After a semi-thorough check, I figured it was an erroneous leftover.  Having read the reviews and after hearing a small rattle when the heater runs, I will be dismounting and tearing it down to install that nut properly.  This is both an inconvenience and really a potential danger.  For that I've removed a star from the rating.That being said, I will be purchasing another one, possibly two more.  Can't beat the price to performance ratio anywhere.Edit from the future:  I bought another one, slightly updated since the first.  This one had no problems and even runs quieter.  Awesome."", ""This heater does a great job heating my 24'x30' insulated shop. I have it on a Honeywell line thermostat, and typically keep it at 40* to keep water lines from freezing, but when I'm ready to work in the ship I just turn it up and in 20 minutes it's nice and toasty. The other day it was 30* outside, but on high this ran for less than 5 minutes every 20-30 minutes.The only potential negative to be aware of is that it has a slight whistle when it's running. It's enough that I think about it every time it starts up, but it's not enough to be a nuisance.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase; it was easy to install, and is cost-effective for the job I needed it to do."", ""Fast shipping.Well packaged.All metal construction.Enough detail in instructions,easily installed,best of all:heater works great.No issues so far.I heat a decent size 2 car garage and this is all I need.Recomend a ceiling fan to force the heat down,same thing with all of 'em.I can not stand beneath this heater when it is on high,it is way beyond my expectations.It is not very big or impressive,but do not let that part fool ya,it is a good heater.I have left the thermostat inside the heater,so far this is working fine."", 'I have used 4 times now and I really like it. If you have a insulated two car garage this heater will do the job nicely.It only took about 30 minutes to go from 30° to  62° in an hour it was 71° had to turn it down to work though. I like it 57° to 63° when working on a project. This heater is perfect for my needs. Little less than $100 too!👍', ""I'm happy with this heater and wish I'd found it years ago. I installed it in my basement workshop and it is way better than the big baseboard heater and kerosene heater I'd been using for many years. It's quiet and easy to install and heats the basement better than I'd anticipated. The workmanship and quality are great and I especially like that the sheet metal parts are post painted as opposed to crummy pre-paint and so all the sheet metal cut edges and corners are painted and nice and smooth and burr free."", 'I use this heater turned down low just to knock the edge off the cold so I can work comfortably in my 3 car garage shop.  I have it set on about 1/3 of its capacity and it keeps the garage at about 55- 60, the way I like it.  If I were to turn it up on high it would make the garage toasty warm.  The installation was straight forward and simple.  I bought a plug, 15 ft. of 10-3 service cord and a cord grip to make the installation. I plug it into my 220 volt welder receptacle when I want to have heat.  Wish I had found it years ago.', 'Great heat output, replaced my floor oil heater and small plug in with this one.  Only reason I gave it a 4 not 5 is that # 1 the fan blade was loose when I got it and the simple mechanism makes a rattling noise that is not necessary.

"Dyna-Glo - Tank Top Propane Gas Heater - 40,000 BTU - Portable - Outdoor Indoor",179.9, ,"['This heater is easily assembled (mounting bracket) and attaches quickly to the propane tank.  If using outside, the heat disbursement can be a narrow range around the setup due to not having a large reflector above the unit. That being said, it still works well when gathered around it.  If using within a ventilated enclosure, such as a garage, this heater when warm the area quickly and keep it that way.  I have yet to use a complete tank with the unit but have put a lot of hours on it.  It seems to not consume propane as fast as I thought it might.. which is a pleasant surprise.', 'This is quite a useful unit. The 360° heat output is perfect for chilly outside events and for use in case of a power outage as a back up, temporary source of heat. Although the burner itself is covered you would need to keep small children in away to avoid burns if touched.', ""Well, it was cold as heck at the last race event we had in Andalusia Alabama. I had to keep my truck running while I was there all day and sat in it between motos. I researched heaters from every avenue I could come up with. HF has a two head burner type that only points in one direction. Other resources sold the same 360 for what I'd consider too much expense. When I saw the price at an affordable cost via this ebay seller I jumped at it so fast I think Paypal felt the wind blowing. The shipping was faster that the ETA date which made it nice. Right now our weather reports conflict from one TV broadcast to the next. All I know is from what I read if it operates at all and I didn't buy a lemon then I feel like I am in luck. Needless to say I haven't used it yet. The weather report for this coming weekend 05 FEB 17 at GAMX in Andalusia doesn't have the temperature dropping to an uncomfortable low like our last event. I will still bring it because I have to be there before 7am so the temperature might be below 40 degrees. Which that might make me want to take it out of the box. One thing I am looking forward to is not having to stand by a bonfire and having the wind shift blow smoke in my face. I understand from what I read it could be possible to roast a mashmellow or cook a hotdog on a stick. But I think I am smart enough even though I live in the bottom of Alabama to step back from the heat at a comfortable distance. I did build a safety feature to hold the 20 lbs propane bottle upright using a stabilizer platform Lowes sold me attached to  a piece of plywood. I hope some person not paying attention doesn' t make a fool out of themselves or blow us all to smiterinez. My finger are starting to get writing cramps and my spell'g is fadin' plus I did the 1st thru the 6th grade twice.

My ma and pa warned me about those kind of ladyz' and my giblets were rumbling with some sort of ovr pwerg  oh my lord what the heck am I writing"", ""the unit heats you at waist height so there no wasted fuel and the tip shut off is a great featureI'm going to buy a couple more they heat my hangar great"", ""I bought this heater for my un-insulated 14x24 foot shop. I've used a kerosene heater for years but when it really gets cold, it just doesn't cut it. I haven't used this Dyna-Glo a lot BUT  when you fire this up, it makes big heat RIGHT NOW! So far, the only drawback I see is that propane is a lot more expensive than kerosene. An $18 20lb bottle will last about 8 hours (I think) and the same time on my kerosene would cost about $5. I'll only use the propane when it's really cold. Bottom line is still....I'd recommend this heater."", 'The Dyna-Glo heater is the best gas heater i have ever owned. I use it to heat my garage when im gonna be out there working for any length of time. It heats my garage very fast. Before i would use my kerosene heater for this purpose and it would take around an hour whereas the Dyna-Glo only takes about 8 to 10 minutes. I tested them both at the same time the other day and the Dyna-Glo on the( low setting) was out heating the kerosene heater on high. This is a great heater, and without the strong kerosene smell. The Dyna-Glo is lightweight and very simple to use and burns very clean. Also has some great safety features and cools off fast after using. I may never use the kerosene heater again."" Sorry ole Friend "".', 'Works great, wish it had an electronic start or even push button, but other than that, love it', 'This heater works PERFECTLY! There\'s a ton of heat generated by this unit which totally and pleasantly surprised me. I use it in my garage for a small gathering of adult beverage consumers and it really kept us warm. One little tip though and that is that so much heat rises from the top of this unit that I rigged a ""hanging"" dome (such as a Weber Grill type lid) about 2 feet above it to keep the heat at a lower level, and this also added a great hand warming option. PERFECT item!!!', 'I used it once.  It hooked up easily.  I had no problems lighting it.  It got hot like it should.', 'This heater is small but works big. It is easy to operate and works good .

Comfort Zone 17065 BTU Ceiling Mount Fan-Forced Electric Heater Furnace Warmer,176.0,30-day returns,"[""easy install, seems to be made well.  love the three heat settingsall parts were present and was packaged well. upon install, turned on power, turned thermostat knob and bam...had instant heat as I had expected...bring on the cold!!.however, one feature that I wish it had was a delayed fan off to cool the heating coils after use. when you rotate the thermostat knob, the fan shuts down immediately, leaving the hot coils to cool off too slowly. also, the unit I received didn't have a visible mark on the thermostat knob for easy identification of position (easily fixed). overall, nice product for the money"", ""So much easier than installing a gas furnace and vent.  Fan creates a full circular heat draft all the way around my 20x20 detached garage.  Heats up quickly and I can then turn it down.  Thermostat works well.  I had a 30 amp welder plug in a good location, so mounted it on the ceiling and used a 10' dryer plug cord.  Quick and easy installation.  Should have done this years ago.  No more freezing with a little space heater."", 'I recommend knowledgäble HVAC guy to add the external thermostat if you need one.  I have high ceilings and wanted to use my mouting system that âttaches to the walls in a corner - no ceiling holes, but two nights of engineering the aluminum mounts.  Hester has been set on low since I installed it and let the Honeywell electronic thermostât do the work.  Waiting for ã heating bill to begin tuning it for optimãl settings depending on weather.  But garage can get hot it works so well.', ""I purchased this heater to use in a 666 sq ft, 4-car, uninsulated, vaulted ceiling garage.  Obviously this is meant to be used in a smaller, more insulated setting.  I wanted to try just one first, and then add as necessary.The heater itself seems to be well-built as far as structure, and designed well as far as installation and operation.  Including running wiring and building a wall mount (vaulted ceiling so no ceiling studs), it took 2-3hrs to get up and running.In my large uninsulated setting, over the course of 3-4hrs, it was able to raise the temperature from 25*F to 45*F, roughly speaking.  In other words, from intolerable to tolerable.  Which is about what I expected from it.  I think it would do quite well at maintaining a higher temperature if I were to use my propane 'salamander' to initially heat the space.Based on other's reviews and my own experience, there seems to be a major quality control concern in the assembly line for these regarding the fan nut.  I was unaware of this until after it was installed, but I'm almost certain I have the same issue as almost everyone else.  Before mounting the heater there was a nut and washer rattling around inside.  After a semi-thorough check, I figured it was an erroneous leftover.  Having read the reviews and after hearing a small rattle when the heater runs, I will be dismounting and tearing it down to install that nut properly.  This is both an inconvenience and really a potential danger.  For that I've removed a star from the rating.That being said, I will be purchasing another one, possibly two more.  Can't beat the price to performance ratio anywhere.Edit from the future:  I bought another one, slightly updated since the first.  This one had no problems and even runs quieter.  Awesome."", ""This heater does a great job heating my 24'x30' insulated shop. I have it on a Honeywell line thermostat, and typically keep it at 40* to keep water lines from freezing, but when I'm ready to work in the ship I just turn it up and in 20 minutes it's nice and toasty. The other day it was 30* outside, but on high this ran for less than 5 minutes every 20-30 minutes.The only potential negative to be aware of is that it has a slight whistle when it's running. It's enough that I think about it every time it starts up, but it's not enough to be a nuisance.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase; it was easy to install, and is cost-effective for the job I needed it to do."", ""Fast shipping.Well packaged.All metal construction.Enough detail in instructions,easily installed,best of all:heater works great.No issues so far.I heat a decent size 2 car garage and this is all I need.Recomend a ceiling fan to force the heat down,same thing with all of 'em.I can not stand beneath this heater when it is on high,it is way beyond my expectations.It is not very big or impressive,but do not let that part fool ya,it is a good heater.I have left the thermostat inside the heater,so far this is working fine."", 'I have used 4 times now and I really like it. If you have a insulated two car garage this heater will do the job nicely.It only took about 30 minutes to go from 30° to  62° in an hour it was 71° had to turn it down to work though. I like it 57° to 63° when working on a project. This heater is perfect for my needs. Little less than $100 too!👍', ""I'm happy with this heater and wish I'd found it years ago. I installed it in my basement workshop and it is way better than the big baseboard heater and kerosene heater I'd been using for many years. It's quiet and easy to install and heats the basement better than I'd anticipated. The workmanship and quality are great and I especially like that the sheet metal parts are post painted as opposed to crummy pre-paint and so all the sheet metal cut edges and corners are painted and nice and smooth and burr free."", 'I use this heater turned down low just to knock the edge off the cold so I can work comfortably in my 3 car garage shop.  I have it set on about 1/3 of its capacity and it keeps the garage at about 55- 60, the way I like it.  If I were to turn it up on high it would make the garage toasty warm.  The installation was straight forward and simple.  I bought a plug, 15 ft. of 10-3 service cord and a cord grip to make the installation. I plug it into my 220 volt welder receptacle when I want to have heat.  Wish I had found it years ago.', 'Great heat output, replaced my floor oil heater and small plug in with this one.

It was a 1500 watt model, but after installing the Com-Pak, that was only 1000 watts, it's output was higher. And it's construction was obviously of high higher quality.  And it is much quieter than old was, even when it was new. Only problem I had was it was slightly smaller to fit into the original hole in the wall.  Not the fault of the heater.

"Mr. Heater Portable Propane Buddy Heater MH 9BX 4,000-9000 BTU Indoor Safe",180.0,30-day returns,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.

Comfort Zone CZ220  5000  Watts Fan-Forced Ceiling Mount Heater 240 V,176.0,80 sold,"[""easy install, seems to be made well.  love the three heat settingsall parts were present and was packaged well. upon install, turned on power, turned thermostat knob and bam...had instant heat as I had expected...bring on the cold!!.however, one feature that I wish it had was a delayed fan off to cool the heating coils after use. when you rotate the thermostat knob, the fan shuts down immediately, leaving the hot coils to cool off too slowly. also, the unit I received didn't have a visible mark on the thermostat knob for easy identification of position (easily fixed). overall, nice product for the money"", ""So much easier than installing a gas furnace and vent.  Fan creates a full circular heat draft all the way around my 20x20 detached garage.  Heats up quickly and I can then turn it down.  Thermostat works well.  I had a 30 amp welder plug in a good location, so mounted it on the ceiling and used a 10' dryer plug cord.  Quick and easy installation.  Should have done this years ago.  No more freezing with a little space heater."", 'I recommend knowledgäble HVAC guy to add the external thermostat if you need one.  I have high ceilings and wanted to use my mouting system that âttaches to the walls in a corner - no ceiling holes, but two nights of engineering the aluminum mounts.  Hester has been set on low since I installed it and let the Honeywell electronic thermostât do the work.  Waiting for ã heating bill to begin tuning it for optimãl settings depending on weather.  But garage can get hot it works so well.', ""I purchased this heater to use in a 666 sq ft, 4-car, uninsulated, vaulted ceiling garage.  Obviously this is meant to be used in a smaller, more insulated setting.  I wanted to try just one first, and then add as necessary.The heater itself seems to be well-built as far as structure, and designed well as far as installation and operation.  Including running wiring and building a wall mount (vaulted ceiling so no ceiling studs), it took 2-3hrs to get up and running.In my large uninsulated setting, over the course of 3-4hrs, it was able to raise the temperature from 25*F to 45*F, roughly speaking.  In other words, from intolerable to tolerable.  Which is about what I expected from it.  I think it would do quite well at maintaining a higher temperature if I were to use my propane 'salamander' to initially heat the space.Based on other's reviews and my own experience, there seems to be a major quality control concern in the assembly line for these regarding the fan nut.  I was unaware of this until after it was installed, but I'm almost certain I have the same issue as almost everyone else.  Before mounting the heater there was a nut and washer rattling around inside.  After a semi-thorough check, I figured it was an erroneous leftover.  Having read the reviews and after hearing a small rattle when the heater runs, I will be dismounting and tearing it down to install that nut properly.  This is both an inconvenience and really a potential danger.  For that I've removed a star from the rating.That being said, I will be purchasing another one, possibly two more.  Can't beat the price to performance ratio anywhere.Edit from the future:  I bought another one, slightly updated since the first.  This one had no problems and even runs quieter.  Awesome."", ""This heater does a great job heating my 24'x30' insulated shop. I have it on a Honeywell line thermostat, and typically keep it at 40* to keep water lines from freezing, but when I'm ready to work in the ship I just turn it up and in 20 minutes it's nice and toasty. The other day it was 30* outside, but on high this ran for less than 5 minutes every 20-30 minutes.The only potential negative to be aware of is that it has a slight whistle when it's running. It's enough that I think about it every time it starts up, but it's not enough to be a nuisance.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase; it was easy to install, and is cost-effective for the job I needed it to do."", ""Fast shipping.Well packaged.All metal construction.Enough detail in instructions,easily installed,best of all:heater works great.No issues so far.I heat a decent size 2 car garage and this is all I need.Recomend a ceiling fan to force the heat down,same thing with all of 'em.I can not stand beneath this heater when it is on high,it is way beyond my expectations.It is not very big or impressive,but do not let that part fool ya,it is a good heater.I have left the thermostat inside the heater,so far this is working fine."", 'I have used 4 times now and I really like it. If you have a insulated two car garage this heater will do the job nicely.It only took about 30 minutes to go from 30° to  62° in an hour it was 71° had to turn it down to work though. I like it 57° to 63° when working on a project. This heater is perfect for my needs. Little less than $100 too!👍', ""I'm happy with this heater and wish I'd found it years ago. I installed it in my basement workshop and it is way better than the big baseboard heater and kerosene heater I'd been using for many years. It's quiet and easy to install and heats the basement better than I'd anticipated. The workmanship and quality are great and I especially like that the sheet metal parts are post painted as opposed to crummy pre-paint and so all the sheet metal cut edges and corners are painted and nice and smooth and burr free."", 'I use this heater turned down low just to knock the edge off the cold so I can work comfortably in my 3 car garage shop.  I have it set on about 1/3 of its capacity and it keeps the garage at about 55- 60, the way I like it.  If I were to turn it up on high it would make the garage toasty warm.  The installation was straight forward and simple.  I bought a plug, 15 ft. of 10-3 service cord and a cord grip to make the installation. I plug it into my 220 volt welder receptacle when I want to have heat.  Wish I had found it years ago.', 'Great heat output, replaced my floor oil heater and small plug in with this one.

If using within a ventilated enclosure, such as a garage, this heater when warm the area quickly and keep it that way.

Although the burner itself is covered you would need to keep small children in away to avoid burns if touched.', ""Well, it was cold as heck at the last race event we had in Andalusia Alabama. I had to keep my truck running while I was there all day and sat in it between motos. I researched heaters from every avenue I could come up with. HF has a two head burner type that only points in one direction. Other resources sold the same 360 for what I'd consider too much expense. When I saw the price at an affordable cost via this ebay seller I jumped at it so fast I think Paypal felt the wind blowing. The shipping was faster that the ETA date which made it nice. Right now our weather reports conflict from one TV broadcast to the next. All I know is from what I read if it operates at all and I didn't buy a lemon then I feel like I am in luck. Needless to say I haven't used it yet. The weather report for this coming weekend 05 FEB 17 at GAMX in Andalusia doesn't have the temperature dropping to an uncomfortable low like our last event. I will still bring it because I have to be there before 7am so the temperature might be below 40 degrees. Which that might make me want to take it out of the box. One thing I am looking forward to is not having to stand by a bonfire and having the wind shift blow smoke in my face. I understand from what I read it could be possible to roast a mashmellow or cook a hotdog on a stick. But I think I am smart enough even though I live in the bottom of Alabama to step back from the heat at a comfortable distance.

So far, the only drawback I see is that propane is a lot more expensive than kerosene. An $18 20lb bottle will last about 8 hours (I think) and the same time on my kerosene would cost about $5.

I use it to heat my garage when im gonna be out there working for any length of time. It heats my garage very fast. Before i would use my kerosene heater for this purpose and it would take around an hour whereas the Dyna-Glo only takes about 8 to 10 minutes. I tested them both at the same time the other day and the Dyna-Glo on the( low setting) was out heating the kerosene heater on high. This is a great heater, and without the strong kerosene smell. The Dyna-Glo is lightweight and very simple to use and burns very clean. Also has some great safety features and cools off fast after using. I may never use the kerosene heater again."" Sorry ole Friend "".', 'Works great, wish it had an electronic start or even push button, but other than that, love it', 'This heater works PERFECTLY! There\'s a ton of heat generated by this unit which totally and pleasantly surprised me. I use it in my garage for a small gathering of adult beverage consumers and it really kept us warm. One little tip though and that is that so much heat rises from the top of this unit that I rigged a ""hanging"" dome (such as a Weber Grill type lid) about 2 feet above it to keep the heat at a lower level, and this also added a great hand warming option.

Fan creates a full circular heat draft all the way around my 20x20 detached garage.  Heats up quickly and I can then turn it down.  Thermostat works well.  I had a 30 amp welder plug in a good location, so mounted it on the ceiling and used a 10' dryer plug cord.  Quick and easy installation.  Should have done this years ago.  No more freezing with a little space heater."", 'I recommend knowledgäble HVAC guy to add the external thermostat if you need one.  I have high ceilings and wanted to use my mouting system that âttaches to the walls in a corner - no ceiling holes, but two nights of engineering the aluminum mounts.  Hester has been set on low since I installed it and let the Honeywell electronic thermostât do the work.  Waiting for ã heating bill to begin tuning it for optimãl settings depending on weather.  But garage can get hot it works so well.', ""I purchased this heater to use in a 666 sq ft, 4-car, uninsulated, vaulted ceiling garage.  Obviously this is meant to be used in a smaller, more insulated setting.  I wanted to try just one first, and then add as necessary.The heater itself seems to be well-built as far as structure, and designed well as far as installation and operation.  Including running wiring and building a wall mount (vaulted ceiling so no ceiling studs), it took 2-3hrs to get up and running.In my large uninsulated setting, over the course of 3-4hrs, it was able to raise the temperature from 25*F to 45*F, roughly speaking.  In other words, from intolerable to tolerable.  Which is about what I expected from it.  I think it would do quite well at maintaining a higher temperature if I were to use my propane 'salamander' to initially heat the space.Based on other's reviews and my own experience, there seems to be a major quality control concern in the assembly line for these regarding the fan nut.  I was unaware of this until after it was installed, but I'm almost certain I have the same issue as almost everyone else.  Before mounting the heater there was a nut and washer rattling around inside.  After a semi-thorough check, I figured it was an erroneous leftover.  Having read the reviews and after hearing a small rattle when the heater runs, I will be dismounting and tearing it down to install that nut properly.  This is both an inconvenience and really a potential danger.  For that I've removed a star from the rating.That being said, I will be purchasing another one, possibly two more.  Can't beat the price to performance ratio anywhere.Edit from the future:  I bought another one, slightly updated since the first.  This one had no problems and even runs quieter.  Awesome."", ""This heater does a great job heating my 24'x30' insulated shop. I have it on a Honeywell line thermostat, and typically keep it at 40* to keep water lines from freezing, but when I'm ready to work in the ship I just turn it up and in 20 minutes it's nice and toasty. The other day it was 30* outside, but on high this ran for less than 5 minutes every 20-30 minutes.The only potential negative to be aware of is that it has a slight whistle when it's running. It's enough that I think about it every time it starts up, but it's not enough to be a nuisance.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase; it was easy to install, and is cost-effective for the job I needed it to do."", ""Fast shipping.Well packaged.All metal construction.Enough detail in instructions,easily installed,best of all:heater works great.No issues so far.I heat a decent size 2 car garage and this is all I need.Recomend a ceiling fan to force the heat down,same thing with all of 'em.I can not stand beneath this heater when it is on high,it is way beyond my expectations.It is not very big or impressive,but do not let that part fool ya,it is a good heater.I have left the thermostat inside the heater,so far this is working fine."", 'I have used 4 times now and I really like it.

I like it 57° to 63° when working on a project. This heater is perfect for my needs. Little less than $100 too!👍', ""I'm happy with this heater and wish I'd found it years ago. I installed it in my basement workshop and it is way better than the big baseboard heater and kerosene heater I'd been using for many years. It's quiet and easy to install and heats the basement better than I'd anticipated. The workmanship and quality are great and I especially like that the sheet metal parts are post painted as opposed to crummy pre-paint and so all the sheet metal cut edges and corners are painted and nice and smooth and burr free."", 'I use this heater turned down low just to knock the edge off the cold so I can work comfortably in my 3 car garage shop.

38-Inch Portable Table Top Stainless Steel Patio Heater - Bestseller,163.95,30-day returns,"[""I love the AZ Patio heater.  I use it on my porch.  Its for a small quaint area.  No bigger. However to help someone understand the Assembly of it know that most of the screws and nuts and bolts are already attached to the heater.  You have to remove them and put them back. I was looking for them to be in the same packaging with the other screws and they're not.  After you finally get it assembled it works well however once again I would  suggest using a larger propane tank as when you're using the smaller portable 1 lb tanks they freeze up after 1 hour.  I noticed that in the other reviews and that is so very correct.  I'm making plans now to purchase a hose to attach to the larger propane tanks that you would use for your grilling purposes."", 'Nice source of outdoor heat.

I drilled the gas orifice out to being 3/64"" diameter, and drilled two 3/8"" holes next to the existing air openings at the venturi, which is inside the the neck tube.

I considered the small propane table top heaters but my wife nixed that idea.  The typical outdoor 8 foot high propane heaters would have probably have drawn to much oxygen from the 13\' X 20\' sun room.  As I searched for other heating options, I came across this heater that stored a 20 lb. tank and made it look aesthetically pleasing.  It provides the right amount of heat for various atmospheric conditions!', 'We use the heater to supplement our fuel oil furnace. Works great to give a shot of heat while maintaining an overall lower temperature while we are gone', 'We got the heater shortly before Christmas 2017 here in Texas. Same day it arrived we had a freeze. Heater was installed in a converted barn and temp got up to about 75 in 15min or so. We have been using it for about a week now in below freezing temps with no issues other than it takes a few clicks to get the pilot to light. With all 3 burners going I pointed my temp gun at the front. My gun only goes to 1,000 deg and the heater is over that.', ""Great heater for my garage/workshop.  The heater puts out enough heat to warm up my 24' x x24' garage on a cold winters day (in Michigan).  With it's 3 settings (Lo, Med &amp; Hi) I start on Hi to raise the temp, then I set it to Lo to maintain temp.  I like the idea that the LP tank is built into the heater (instead of a separate tank and extension hose).  It makes the heater easy to roll around the shop and set it where the heat is needed.  I've had no issues with it not starting or operating properly.All in all, this is one great little portable heater.  I'd definitely but it again."", 'It is exactly what we needed. Works great and heats fast. Great product.', 'It is used every day sometimes three or four times to take the chill off in my 14 x 30 cabin. Fifteen min. or so is all it takes even when it is 12 fa outside. Wish I had it last year. Thanks Mr Heater !', ""I've had this heater for a month now and have used it in my garage. It works great in the garage even when it was 20 degrees outside. On high, I have to sit about 2 feet away or I start to get too hot. I normally turn it to medium setting once I start getting hot. It takes about 5 minutes to get up to full heat, and very minimum fumes.  I'm still using my first tank of gas! I love this heater!"", 'This heater holds a 20-pound propane tank. It does a good job of providing radiant heat. The pilot light ignites automatically, making the heater easy to use. I am happy with it, although I have used it only three times so far.', 'fast shipping and heats up the area we needed it for quit fast', 'Works great, Gives off perfect amount of heat with the three settings.Recommended to anyone that is cold, and on a budget for heat.I first learned of these while in Greece in the navy. we used them over winter, where the climate was not so cold, but, you still needed something for quick heat to take the chill off.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr. Heater Portable Buddy Propane Heater Outdoor Camping Job Site 18000 BTU,180.08, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Dr Infrared Heater DR-122 Bedbug Heater with Thermometer and Timer, Big, Black",180.0, ,"[""The unit was easy to assemble and we had it quickly up and running in 20 minutes. The quality of components and hardware is good and the instructions were easy to follow. The deciding factor in purchasing this unit was that it ran off of one 110v outlet. Other units that we looked at required multiple circuits (one required 4).In regard to negative feedback, it is nominal but the S clips that hold the center racks in place are very loose and it would be nice if Dr. Infrared would design them a little bit more rigid. The temp gauge/meter is of good quality but you need to understand that the timer counts back and not forward as to how long the unit has been on.We deal with bed bugs daily at our men's homeless shelter and it is so nice to take their belongings and quickly bake the little buggers out in under two hours. We are seriously thinking about getting a couple more tents in the near future."", ""Although I am grateful for a solution that doesn't cost thousands of dollars I have three complaints about this bed bug heater:1. The instructions are cursory, especially given how concerned most users will be to do things correctly, and the diagrams for assembly are faint. A link to a video would be great.2. The hooks to hold the shelves on WILL NOT fit in half the holes pre-drilled in the poles. And I mean WILL NOT with the force of two adults twisting and grunting in awkward physical positions. The holes are simply inadequately made. Note that I did get the other half in, so it is not that I cannot figure out how to do it, although a better diagram and an explanation would have helped see complaint #1.3. It takes HOURS to heat up to 120F and it's a really hot summer here! Would have been nice to know that. See #1.A minor disappointment is that the timer has no presets. A huge design bonus would be if the thermometre-timer could shut off the heater at the appropriate time.

Gas Heater Mr. Heater MH12HB Hunting Buddy Portable Propane 6000 to 12000 BTU,180.0, ,"[""we finally got to use our mr. buddy heater while camping in our pop up tent this past weekend. waking up around 4 or 5 in the morning with the temperature about 45 degrees....that's a little chilly for us desert dwellers. mr. buddy takes the chill off in just a few minutes. the small, green portable propane tanks do get a bit frosty after about 45 minutes and if they are almost empty the unit just stops. I'm not sure if the unit stopping is due to the oxygen sensor or the bottled propane tank chilling because I used a partially filled bottle first, assumed it was empty, but found it still had liquid in it. after a few minutes I reinstalled it and started right up and ran until it was empty. we did have ample ventilation as the old pop up is not so tight and also we had the vent cracked a little. we experienced no headaches or notice of any lack of oxygen. all in all we really like it and recommend this to anyone. even on the low setting this unit does the trick. we found our large propane tank was empty when we got there so we did not get to use with the hose. the built in fan does work but we didn't use it this time. on a scale of 1 to 10 I give this item an automatic 20!

"18"" Black Red Hi Med Low 18000 BTU Outdoor Portable Radiant Propane Heater",181.54, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Mr. Heater Portable Propane Buddy Heater MH 9BX 4,000-9000 BTU Indoor Safe",180.0,30-day returns,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.

Gas Heater Mr. Heater MH12HB Hunting Buddy Portable Propane 6000 to 12000 BTU,180.0, ,"[""we finally got to use our mr. buddy heater while camping in our pop up tent this past weekend. waking up around 4 or 5 in the morning with the temperature about 45 degrees....that's a little chilly for us desert dwellers. mr. buddy takes the chill off in just a few minutes. the small, green portable propane tanks do get a bit frosty after about 45 minutes and if they are almost empty the unit just stops. I'm not sure if the unit stopping is due to the oxygen sensor or the bottled propane tank chilling because I used a partially filled bottle first, assumed it was empty, but found it still had liquid in it. after a few minutes I reinstalled it and started right up and ran until it was empty. we did have ample ventilation as the old pop up is not so tight and also we had the vent cracked a little. we experienced no headaches or notice of any lack of oxygen. all in all we really like it and recommend this to anyone. even on the low setting this unit does the trick. we found our large propane tank was empty when we got there so we did not get to use with the hose. the built in fan does work but we didn't use it this time. on a scale of 1 to 10 I give this item an automatic 20! I like it that much."", 'I have only 20 amps in my live work space.After running lights, television and other stuff, I did not have enough current left to run a space heater.

"18"" Black Red Hi Med Low 18000 BTU Outdoor Portable Radiant Propane Heater",181.54, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Mr. Heater Portable Propane Buddy Heater MH 9BX 4,000-9000 BTU Indoor Safe",180.0,30-day returns,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.

Gas Heater Mr. Heater MH12HB Hunting Buddy Portable Propane 6000 to 12000 BTU,180.0, ,"[""we finally got to use our mr. buddy heater while camping in our pop up tent this past weekend. waking up around 4 or 5 in the morning with the temperature about 45 degrees....that's a little chilly for us desert dwellers. mr. buddy takes the chill off in just a few minutes. the small, green portable propane tanks do get a bit frosty after about 45 minutes and if they are almost empty the unit just stops. I'm not sure if the unit stopping is due to the oxygen sensor or the bottled propane tank chilling because I used a partially filled bottle first, assumed it was empty, but found it still had liquid in it. after a few minutes I reinstalled it and started right up and ran until it was empty. we did have ample ventilation as the old pop up is not so tight and also we had the vent cracked a little. we experienced no headaches or notice of any lack of oxygen. all in all we really like it and recommend this to anyone. even on the low setting this unit does the trick. we found our large propane tank was empty when we got there so we did not get to use with the hose. the built in fan does work but we didn't use it this time. on a scale of 1 to 10 I give this item an automatic 20! I like it that much."", 'I have only 20 amps in my live work space.After running lights, television and other stuff, I did not have enough current left to run a space heater.

"18"" Black Red Hi Med Low 18000 BTU Outdoor Portable Radiant Propane Heater",181.54, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.

And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.

I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable.

It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.

Dyna Glo Glow Kerosene Radiant Heater RMC 55R7 Indoor 10000 BTU  ,185.0, ,"['It is a good heater for a small tool shed or whatever. It is very easy to light and good on fuel.You do need to read the directions on shutting heater down, these newer ones are not likethe older models, whereas you could just hit the shut down button. You do need to turn knob regulator for heat down and hold shut off button in, if not the glass bowl will jump and cause the balancer inside to malfunction which it will not light again until taken apart and fixed. happy withproduct here in Vermont where it is COLD. It takes it time to heat my 160 sq. ft. tool shed butthis is Vermont. Very happy and satisfied with this product. Also my tool shed is well insulated ceiling and all walls.', ""Great heater easy to use and way cheaper than electricity !!!!!!!also great for when the power go's out .!"", 'This is a great supplement to my power. I am working to get off the grid and this is keeping me nice and toasty.Very quick shipping too', ""I have found this model to be reliable enough to rely on for primary heating, not just an occasional use.  My home electric service the only fuel utility in a rural area available for heating short of the purchase of a propane tank and full house heating system - an unregulated (Ohio) electric co-operative with an average winter electric bill exceeding $600 per month when used for heat.  The unit burns well with little to no odor or unburned fuel, lasts on the tank provided for the time rated (10 hours or more), is very safe when located properly, radiates heat in only the direction designed, and very easy to operate.  For $129 it is an excellent value, and this makes my third (not replacements but additional).  It out performs Dyna-Glo's later model 10K which can be distinguished as the newer one's dimensions are taller.  Comes in the beige here or brown.  Safe, well-engineered, cost effective to use, and reasonably priced at $129."", 'I got this heater to take the chill off of my Woodshop.

"Mr. Heater Portable Propane Buddy Heater MH 9BX 4,000-9000 BTU Indoor Safe",180.0,30-day returns,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.

It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.

Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used.

It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent!

"Mr. Heater MH9BX 9000 BTU Propane Portable Buddy Heater, MH9BX New",190.0, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Mr. Heater F274805 Big Buddy Propane Portable Heater, 18000 BTU",188.04,30-day returns,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Broan 157 Aluminum Radiant Heater With Long Life Element & Built-In Fan - 1250W,187.96, ,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation.

The heater was received and installed in mid September and it worked great, quiet and smooth.  This week when we went to turn it on as the weather got colder, the fan spun up but made this awful clatter.  I took off the top but could not see anything that was causing the noise.  Then the unit stopped altogether, the fan wouldn't start up and no heat was emitted.  This unit replaced the same model that we had for the last 6 to 7 years with no problems.  We really like the heater but we're upset that this unit did not work."", 'This is kick space heater replaced one of same model.

Mr. Heater Big Buddy 18000 Btu/Hr. 450 Sq. Ft. Portable Propane Heater,187.52,30-day returns,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr. Heater Big Buddy 18000 Btu/Hr. 450 Sq. Ft. Portable Propane Heater,187.52,30-day returns,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Broan-Nutone Kickspace Heater w Built-In Thermostat,189.99, ,"[""The Broan 112 heater came just as advertised as an open box item.  Once opened it was perfect, no scratches or dents.  The heater was received and installed in mid September and it worked great, quiet and smooth.  This week when we went to turn it on as the weather got colder, the fan spun up but made this awful clatter.  I took off the top but could not see anything that was causing the noise.  Then the unit stopped altogether, the fan wouldn't start up and no heat was emitted.  This unit replaced the same model that we had for the last 6 to 7 years with no problems.  We really like the heater but we're upset that this unit did not work."", 'This is kick space heater replaced one of same model.

Dyna Glo Glow Kerosene Radiant Heater RMC 55R7 Indoor 10000 BTU  ,185.0, ,"['It is a good heater for a small tool shed or whatever. It is very easy to light and good on fuel.You do need to read the directions on shutting heater down, these newer ones are not likethe older models, whereas you could just hit the shut down button. You do need to turn knob regulator for heat down and hold shut off button in, if not the glass bowl will jump and cause the balancer inside to malfunction which it will not light again until taken apart and fixed. happy withproduct here in Vermont where it is COLD.

The unit burns well with little to no odor or unburned fuel, lasts on the tank provided for the time rated (10 hours or more), is very safe when located properly, radiates heat in only the direction designed, and very easy to operate.

When the heater came, it was in almost newcosmetic and like new operational condition!  I was veryhappy!I have used it for 3 weeks so far in my 625 Sq. Ft. garagewith outside air temperatures as low as 24F.   At 24F, ittakes about an hour to heat the garage to 65F+; then itcycles on and off after that and maintains thetemperature just fine.  I haven\'t had to turn the thermostatup more than 2/3 of the way to be able to work in asummer shirt and jeans.BTW my garage is insulated and sheet-rocked on all thewalls and the ceiling.  (The ceiling is 9 1/2\' high.)  Thegarage doors are also insulated with foam sheets in thepanels.I put the heater on the floor (as required by the safetyinstructions) facing into the garage.  It sits on and blowsacross a carpet which never gets warm as the heat goesup.  The heater fan keeps the air mixed well and keepsthe temperature even throughout the garage. ', ""I think this is a decent heater. Easy install, quiet, simple, but it does take a while to get room heat up. On a cold day I might need 3+ hours to get the room to working temp here in the Northeast..

I have a 1225 sq ft garage with tall ceilings and this keeps it a nice 60 degrees at all times. I was not expecting it to keep the garage so nice and warm.

Mr. Heater Big Buddy 18000 Btu/Hr. 450 Sq. Ft. Portable Propane Heater,187.52,30-day returns,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.

', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr. Heater MH9BX Portable Propane Buddy Heater NEW!,195.0, ,"[""I have been hunting working outside and in the elements for the last 25 years. I particularly use this brand and model for most of my outdoor activities when the need for heat rises. This product is one of the best and only ones that I carried for hunting ice fishing and other activities period lightweight excellent instruction dependable and reliable on a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 9.5. Only for the fact nothing is ever truly perfect. But if I've ever had an issue with one it was sent back one was replaced or fixed with no problems or issues I highly recommend this unit for anyone looking for a portable way to keep warm on the go outdoors in the elements."", ""I haven't actually tried it on a camping trip yet but I am confident that this will be sufficient to safely take the chill off my conversion van so I am to catch a few hours nap when traveling without running the gas engine to keep warm. It's very easy to use but be patient after installing the LP gas bottle. You will have to hold the button starer for 30-60 second to purge the fuel line of air before the gas actually starts flowing to the burner. Once purged it starts very quickly!"", 'It is a wonderful product.  It is very simple to operate and has an attractive design.  It burns very cleanly with only a faint smell of propane.  Even on the low setting, it warms a 300-ft. area very quickly.  I do not yet know how long a one-pound container of Propane will burn.   It also has a convenient carrying case that holds the heater unit and two one-pound bottles of Propane.  That makes it easy to store, and it takes up very little space. I give it five stars (out of a possible five).  We had an ice storm in Oklahoma last year that knocked out power for over a week; my little apartment was freezing.  With Mr. Heater in the closet, I feel safe and secure for the next power outage.', ""Well first of all I started out as a Coleman heater man and I didn't think no other propane heater brand could outdo the Coleman product but Mr heater portable buddy does with greater heat output. The only thing that Mr heater could improve on is a way to regulate the heat temperature. It's just low 4000 btu to high 9000 btu and that can get to hot in a small area. Other than that so far, I find it to be a very good propane heater. Won't be going back to Coleman. For one thing their heaters wear out fast."", ""i really like this heater,this is the second one i bought.. the first one is still working fine..i'm writing this review based on that one. it has worked flawlessly. i use it all the time on the boat, all winter..it's a 34 foot boat with a large cabin that i use all winter.10 mins and the chill is gone. in 30 mins we're opening coats and relaxing..a 1 lb tank lasts all night on high..have taken it camping this year.. kept us warm &amp; cozy.the downloaded pdf instruction manual says it's safe for indoor use..but there still a CO2 warning..as with any other fire producing device..haven't had any problems at all with it...although i did have to clean a spider web from the pilot light in the fall.. i took the entire thing apart jut to see how it works.. very simple to work on..and i checked on line for any replacement parts.. all of the parts are available and fairly cheap.that makes it totally fixable..the safety features work almost too well.. a bump and it shuts off.. never had the tip over safety needed, but it has been checked.new in the store for 95$.. bought it used for 65/w shipping.."", ""If you are considering to buy a portable gas heater, so it's the one you have been looking for. It's very safe, light, has posibility to connect to big tank and looks solid.It has few safety off switches: turn over, flame out and low oxygen (this one I wasn't able to find in any other device) so this means that you can use it almost anywhere. It is very light and it came with carycase with wich it is even more comfartable to have it with you. It use not that much propane compared to how much heat it gives. It has two working modes High an Low. so far I have noticed that it uses about 100 grams (3.5 ounces) per hour in High mode and I think that it might use more than twice in low mode. It gives sufient heat to heat a room of 140 feet. And if it is not enaugh for you it has it's biger version with twice more power.Though it gives a bit of odor, but it is not that much noticible.So as I said, if you are looking for portable gas heater it is the one."", ""I bought this heater to take along tent camping when I go to different hunting places throughout the state. The heater seems to be very dependable. It is easy to start and to stop. I have used other Mr. Heater brand heaters for several years and they hold up well. The size is correct for my needs and heats my space easily. The 1 pound bottle attaches easily and is removed easily. It's a great little heater. It is a bit larger than I expected, but that does not effect how I will use it."", ""The Buddy Heater is an excellent idea with some flaws. I use mine nearly every day of winter. A ceramic heater is perfect for indoor use. You don't have to worry about carbon monoxide gas, and if you crack a window, the oxygen won't deplete. I love my heater! However, the Buddy Heater is not engineered well. All gas and propane are saturated with a very stinky oil which smells like rotten eggs so you will recognize it when you smell it. The Buddy Heater's small tubing, which delivers the gas to the the pilot light and ceramic heater, will condense out this oil in cold weather. When the tube fills with oil to a certain point, oil will get to the pilot orifice tube; this tube has a special glass filled hole that meters the pilot flame. Once that clogs -no pilot flame. No pilot flame, no worky. Mr Heater will sell you another pilot and ignition set, but this does not address the oil sitting in the tube. It will clog even faster. I have tried to call them to encourage them to change the design, but they just ignore me. My solution, and it works, is to carefully take the back off, remove the pilot assembly, unscrew the pilot orifice and put a pipe cleaner through the supply line. I then take pliers and put the orifice piece over a torch flame and heat it until it is smoking; hot enough to burn out the oil. I put it back together and it will work for another 2 months, (everyday use) before it clogs again. I  tried buying their in-line filter, but it still clogs up. The oil molecules are small enough to get past the filter. So I recommend the heater, but it's a real hassle when it stops working on a cold night!"", ""Excellent for portability and heating. Easy to use and simple to clean.  The downside of portable heaters it the short heating time.. 3 hours on full... up to 8 hours on ... thrifty usage.  Let alone the high cost of propane items now.For a permanent long time use I recommend the Olympian series heaters for durability.. all metal. The buddy heaters are excellent tho with excellent components and durability.Don't drop em tho.. the thermocouple moves a bit and it'll shut off all the time if you do not know where to move it back to."", 'I already had a good experience with the Mr Heater MH9B since my dad had purchased 3 of these a few years ago for our various hunting shacks. Very pleased with the updated design making the lighting of the heater easier with the pilot ignitor built into the adjustment knob and the swivel connector for the propane tank is a nice feature. Did an excellent job heating my hunting blind and also the area in my garage where we processed our deer. Would strongly recommend this heater to anyone.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Dr. Heater DR966 240-volt Hardwired Shop Garage Commercial Heater, 3000-watt/...",192.99,30-day returns,"['The heater requires a 35A circuit with #8AWG wire per Article 424 of the National Electric Code. The heater only pulls 25A on highest setting, but is considered a ""fixed"" device with a ""continuous load"", so the wiring and breaker need to be rated at 125%.  That puts it at 31.25A, over a #10AWG wire and 30A breaker\'s rating.  Don\'t risk your insurance company denying your claim if something goes wrong.At that power, you don\'t want to use a line voltage thermostat designed for smaller baseboard heaters.  If you want a wall mounted thermostat, look into any conventional thermostat, a 24VAC HVAC transformer, and a 40A 2-pole 24V HVAC contactor.  I have three DR-966 heaters with their built-in thermostats all the way up and their switches on the 6000W setting, running off a single 24V transformer and Hunter 429999B thermostat, with a contactor near each heater switching the 240V AC on and off.  If I\'m not in the building I keep the thermostat at its minimum 45 degrees setting to prevent pipes from freezing.  Using a contactor, you\'re essentially automating turning the heater on and off, no different than using the instruction manual\'s method of using the circuit breaker, and not voiding any warranty.This is not an infrared heater, the manufacturer calls itself both Dr. Heater and Dr. Infrared Heater.  The heater is a wire coil type, the front two coils are 1500 watts each tied together, the rear coil is a single 3000 watt for a total of 6000 watts.  With the fan blowing on them, a spiral or two of the rear coil may get red, primarily near the coil supports.  If the fan doesn\'t turn the coil will get red hot, and probably break the support wire inside and then droop.  I received one heater that had a bent fan bracket not allowing the blade to turn and when powered up the rear coil did just that.  I received a refund to buy a third heater and since the vendor was filing a damage claim, was told to discard the defective heater if after 10 days the shipping carrier didn\'t contact me to inspect it.  After the 10 days passed without being contacted, I straightened the bracket out, verified the fan worked and then adjusted the drooping rear coil so there was a minimum of red spots.  I ended up with 3 heaters for the price of 2.Although the output of the heaters may feel like no more than a hand held hair dryer when your area is cold, follow the instruction manual\'s recommendations of keeping it the proper distances from walls and other objects.  If you feel it isn\'t putting out like it should, use a clamp-on ammeter to verify the heater is drawing around 25A on each leg with the temperature control fully clockwise and the switch on 6000W.  If it\'s not, contact the vendor.I have a 30x50 pole barn shop with a 10\' ceiling, so the roof peak is about 12\'.  It has ""double bubble foil"" insulation on the walls and roof, with exposed trusses.  The heater\'s manual recommends 1.25 watts of heating per cubic foot, so 30\' x 50\' x 11\' x 1.25W = 20,625 watts.  With 18,000W of heaters, I can set the thermostat at 60, go to the home store 10 miles away and by the time I get back the heaters have shut off.  If I already have my materials and I\'m in a hurry to get started, I supplement the electrics with a 3-burner 45,000 BTU tank-mounted propane heater to raise the temp to 60 faster.  So a single 6000W heater in an uninsulated 3-car garage may not be adequate.Before I contacted the eBay vendor about the damaged heater, I contacted the Dr. Heater by phone.  They told me they would send a replacement heater and pre-paid shipping label.  Then I received an email stating they would email me a label within one business day and start the replacement process.  I never received the label by email.  When I called Dr. Heater on the second business day they said they would email a label by the end of the day.  I never got that, so I resolved the issue with the eBay vendor, a 10 star solution.  So it may not be worth the stamp to send in your warranty card.  If you get a working unit, it\'s worth the money.  Good luck repairing one later, since parts don\'t seem to be available.  Due to one of mine having a bent fan bracket, if you get a DR-966 in the 160014xx serial number range, stick a screwdriver in the back and try to spin the fan blade before installation.  A pallet of these might have gotten dropped on the dock after coming off a ship from China.  If that bracket was bent before the heater was assembled, then don\'t trust the QC sticker on the back. It hasn\'t got to zero outside yet, and I haven\'t got my first electric bill, so I may be in for a shock in that respect.', ""It's an OK heater. You MUST user the heavy 8 gauge wire and the 35 amp circuit breakers that the instructions say. It has a much quieter fan than my old one, so that's a really nice thing. Puts out a good amount of heat for a small heater. So Great so far? The only bad thing that I have to say about it, is the same as a couple other reviews. The thermostat just doesn't work right. It turns on at 65 degrees and cycles on and off like you would expect. But during the day it keeps turning on more and more warming up the shop by turning on at higher and higher temps. By the end of the day it was turning on at 79 degrees and this was with the thermostat not being moved, set the same all day long. So if it had a better thermostat it would easily be a 5 Star heater. Better yet a remote mounted thermostat would be Great! Heats up my well insulated shop 20X16X8 even when it dropped to zero outside. So it's a GREAT heater with a crappy thermostat.         "", 'Installed this heater on a 20 degree day in a dairy milk house ( block building). It had that space up 65 degrees in 20 minutes.This was at the full 6000 watts. Then left the thermostat at 3/4. This was adequate for me. Maybe 70 degrees at full power? A really quality unit for price!', '1000 square foot shop stays warm when it’s 30 degrees outside. I keep the temp about 58 to 60 when working. Any warmer and it’s not comfortable. Fairly quite on high.  Great value on a heater. Propane was costly and dangerous in a shop using flammable liquids. ', 'I got this as an open box, but looks brand new.  Got it for a great price.  I have it on a 30 amp breaker with #10 wire.

Lasko 1500-Watt 120-Volt Bathroom Electric Space Heater CD08200 Pack of 4,190.26,30-day returns,"[""I put this bathroom heater in my bedroom to compare with another good Lasko room heater of similar size and the same 1500 W but with different features. I like the angle of the heat blast from this bathroom heater better for when I'm sitting on my bed getting dressed in front of the heater, I am happier with the other in my office. which has a steeper angle of blast and a thermostat.I also use this bathroom heater in the bathroom for which it was intended. I wanted it above the sink level for safety, as there's nowhere else to put the heater but on the sink counter.  I  turned a fire safe small ceramic square kleenex holder upside down, and the heater's feet fit nicelyinside.This bathroom heater is convenient because of the one press button for a preset one hour of high heat for quick warmups such as in the bathroom or when getting dressed. No fussing with buttons. It also has High and Low settings that run without a timer.I also noticed that some sellers were saying their heaters were OK for the bathroom but the actual manufacturer did not.  This Bathroom heater is designed for the bathroom.  I'm not sure if the tripper in the cord is necessary if the outlet has one too, as many houses do these days in any water environment such as the bathroom or the kitchen.  I'm guessing the tripper in the plug reacts to the unit rather than the wall socket."", ""This heater does an excellent job of putting out a lot of air with the fan and also Heats the room excellently. For my application I'm using it in a fifth wheel trailer bathroom which is fairly small but one of the problems I'm having with the heater is I'm using a different thermostat on it that is more accurate to turn on and off and the heater shuts off and doesn't come back on when I use the thermostat on it so what you need to do is put something on the round button on top of the heater and tape it down to hold the button down all the time so that thermostat that I've got set up works properly and we'll kick the heater on when the temperature drops or more so when I want to heat the bathroom during a certain time of the day like when I take a shower.Otherwise the heater is an excellent heater and I would highly recommend anybody to buy it very good quality."", 'The heater is modern in design. It has a one hour feature that I love. I turn it on , shower get dressed in a warm bathroom, never have to wonder if I left it running. It automatically shuts off after 1 hour.', ""1. easy to turn on and off2. heats up fast3. has 1-hour auto shutoff4. very sturdy design, not likely to tip over5. made for humid areas like bathroomsbonus: it's cute!"", ""Here's the story:  To have my small bathroom warm when I get up in the morning for my shower, I had a small ceramic 1500 Watt heater connected into a wall timer to turn on automatically, and if I forgot (which I often did) to turn off automatically. With this Lasko heater, I tap the top when I'm ready to shower and it turns on high for one hour. Firstly, I don't have to remember to turn it off. Secondly, the velocity of the hot air coming out is so high that the bathroom heats up much quicker than my other heater, even though the wattage of both units is the same. This saves my electric bill.It seems to be good, quality wise, but it's only a month old now so we'll see.  November, 2020A note:  After it's turned off, and the top button (the big and only one) is tapped, it starts at the timed one hour 1500 Watt setting automatically."", ""It is difficult to find a space heater that is specifically for bathroom use. I was happy to find this one at this price and good reviews! It does exactly what I need it to do, I warm up my bathroom before a shower as my heat does not do that well - North side of house in Wisconsin! I will see how it holds up this winter, but so far very pleased with it's performance."", 'Works great! Instant heat . Small size is great. Comes with wet location plug  &amp; cord', ""Perfect replacement for my old heater that finally died. Small, lightweight, gets super warm in my little bathroom. Like that it's specifically made to use in a bathroom. Warming, the front grill can get hot!"", 'This little heater has all the power i need to heat up the bathroom in a hurry.

"BROAN 157 Srfce-Mnt Elct Ceil Htr,2-11/16""H,1250W",192.29, ,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation. The power to the heater tested good.', ""Love this little heater, just renivating my Mum's home.   It's so nice to have this little heater in the basement bath.  Very reasonable in price and a nice touch!!!"", 'Brand new unused, unopened.  Excellent purchase. ', 'The Broan 157 ceiling heater is a great upgrade from the "" twisted wire element "" heater.

"Mr. Heater MH9BX 9000 BTU Propane Portable Buddy Heater, MH9BX New",190.0, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"New Mr Heater Big Buddy Portable Propane Heater 18,000 BTU For Up To 450 Sq Ft",194.99,15 watchers,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

18K LP CABINET HEATER,193.64, ,"['I\'ve wrestled with the heating options for my sun room since my wife and daughter through out my ""old"" kerosene heaters.  I considered the small propane table top heaters but my wife nixed that idea.  The typical outdoor 8 foot high propane heaters would have probably have drawn to much oxygen from the 13\' X 20\' sun room.  As I searched for other heating options, I came across this heater that stored a 20 lb. tank and made it look aesthetically pleasing.  It provides the right amount of heat for various atmospheric conditions!', 'We use the heater to supplement our fuel oil furnace. Works great to give a shot of heat while maintaining an overall lower temperature while we are gone', 'We got the heater shortly before Christmas 2017 here in Texas. Same day it arrived we had a freeze. Heater was installed in a converted barn and temp got up to about 75 in 15min or so. We have been using it for about a week now in below freezing temps with no issues other than it takes a few clicks to get the pilot to light. With all 3 burners going I pointed my temp gun at the front. My gun only goes to 1,000 deg and the heater is over that.', ""Great heater for my garage/workshop.  The heater puts out enough heat to warm up my 24' x x24' garage on a cold winters day (in Michigan).  With it's 3 settings (Lo, Med &amp; Hi) I start on Hi to raise the temp, then I set it to Lo to maintain temp.  I like the idea that the LP tank is built into the heater (instead of a separate tank and extension hose).  It makes the heater easy to roll around the shop and set it where the heat is needed.  I've had no issues with it not starting or operating properly.All in all, this is one great little portable heater.  I'd definitely but it again."", 'It is exactly what we needed. Works great and heats fast. Great product.', 'It is used every day sometimes three or four times to take the chill off in my 14 x 30 cabin.

It works great in the garage even when it was 20 degrees outside. On high, I have to sit about 2 feet away or I start to get too hot. I normally turn it to medium setting once I start getting hot. It takes about 5 minutes to get up to full heat, and very minimum fumes.  I'm still using my first tank of gas! I love this heater!"", 'This heater holds a 20-pound propane tank.

All you have to do is run it at max (all burners on high) until you get the room to the desired temperature, and then drop it down to one burner on low. If your room has decent insulation (mine is average) one burner on low will maintain the temp. With a FULL 40lb cylinder expect every bit of the manual's stated 70hr runtime with one burner on low."", 'It’s great and heats up my 20x50 un-insulated shop in about an hr in 30* weather.

"New Mr Heater Big Buddy Portable Propane Heater 18,000 BTU For Up To 450 Sq Ft",194.99,15 watchers,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

18K LP CABINET HEATER,193.64, ,"['I\'ve wrestled with the heating options for my sun room since my wife and daughter through out my ""old"" kerosene heaters.  I considered the small propane table top heaters but my wife nixed that idea.  The typical outdoor 8 foot high propane heaters would have probably have drawn to much oxygen from the 13\' X 20\' sun room.  As I searched for other heating options, I came across this heater that stored a 20 lb. tank and made it look aesthetically pleasing.  It provides the right amount of heat for various atmospheric conditions!', 'We use the heater to supplement our fuel oil furnace. Works great to give a shot of heat while maintaining an overall lower temperature while we are gone', 'We got the heater shortly before Christmas 2017 here in Texas. Same day it arrived we had a freeze. Heater was installed in a converted barn and temp got up to about 75 in 15min or so. We have been using it for about a week now in below freezing temps with no issues other than it takes a few clicks to get the pilot to light. With all 3 burners going I pointed my temp gun at the front. My gun only goes to 1,000 deg and the heater is over that.', ""Great heater for my garage/workshop.  The heater puts out enough heat to warm up my 24' x x24' garage on a cold winters day (in Michigan).  With it's 3 settings (Lo, Med &amp; Hi) I start on Hi to raise the temp, then I set it to Lo to maintain temp.  I like the idea that the LP tank is built into the heater (instead of a separate tank and extension hose).  It makes the heater easy to roll around the shop and set it where the heat is needed.  I've had no issues with it not starting or operating properly.All in all, this is one great little portable heater.  I'd definitely but it again."", 'It is exactly what we needed.

I is a super-comfortable source of heat!  My wife and I plan on having our evening glass of wine today using this heater.  It applies significant heat to keep out table area comfortable even if we have guests come over.  All-in-all it is a great source of instant heat for a multitude of uses.  Thanks.  Alfredo R. Padilla', ""I used this heater for a home that was in the process of being converted from propane to natural gas. It maintained a 700+ sq-ft room between 67-70F with outside temps in the high 20's to low 30's and relative humidity %60+ with one burner on lowest setting. All you have to do is run it at max (all burners on high) until you get the room to the desired temperature, and then drop it down to one burner on low. If your room has decent insulation (mine is average) one burner on low will maintain the temp. With a FULL 40lb cylinder expect every bit of the manual's stated 70hr runtime with one burner on low."", 'It’s great and heats up my 20x50 un-insulated shop in about an hr in 30* weather.

"New Mr Heater Big Buddy Portable Propane Heater 18,000 BTU For Up To 450 Sq Ft",194.99,15 watchers,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Works great to give a shot of heat while maintaining an overall lower temperature while we are gone', 'We got the heater shortly before Christmas 2017 here in Texas. Same day it arrived we had a freeze. Heater was installed in a converted barn and temp got up to about 75 in 15min or so. We have been using it for about a week now in below freezing temps with no issues other than it takes a few clicks to get the pilot to light. With all 3 burners going I pointed my temp gun at the front. My gun only goes to 1,000 deg and the heater is over that.', ""Great heater for my garage/workshop.  The heater puts out enough heat to warm up my 24' x x24' garage on a cold winters day (in Michigan).  With it's 3 settings (Lo, Med &amp; Hi) I start on Hi to raise the temp, then I set it to Lo to maintain temp.  I like the idea that the LP tank is built into the heater (instead of a separate tank and extension hose).  It makes the heater easy to roll around the shop and set it where the heat is needed.  I've had no issues with it not starting or operating properly.All in all, this is one great little portable heater.  I'd definitely but it again."", 'It is exactly what we needed. Works great and heats fast. Great product.', 'It is used every day sometimes three or four times to take the chill off in my 14 x 30 cabin. Fifteen min. or so is all it takes even when it is 12 fa outside. Wish I had it last year. Thanks Mr Heater !', ""I've had this heater for a month now and have used it in my garage. It works great in the garage even when it was 20 degrees outside. On high, I have to sit about 2 feet away or I start to get too hot. I normally turn it to medium setting once I start getting hot. It takes about 5 minutes to get up to full heat, and very minimum fumes.  I'm still using my first tank of gas! I love this heater!"", 'This heater holds a 20-pound propane tank. It does a good job of providing radiant heat. The pilot light ignites automatically, making the heater easy to use. I am happy with it, although I have used it only three times so far.', 'fast shipping and heats up the area we needed it for quit fast', 'Works great, Gives off perfect amount of heat with the three settings.Recommended to anyone that is cold, and on a budget for heat.I first learned of these while in Greece in the navy. we used them over winter, where the climate was not so cold, but, you still needed something for quick heat to take the chill off.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

All you have to do is run it at max (all burners on high) until you get the room to the desired temperature, and then drop it down to one burner on low.

The front grill (chromed) will turn dark a bit but that’s to be expected. Enough heat for a 4x6m room when usign Liquid Propane gas. I used Butane and it was amazingly efficient (you feel the heat even with the pilot! Not even a single burner) but butane is difficult to find where i live.Comes with gas regulator, ready for a left internal thread. Easy to operate and very light to move around the house. Planning to buy another one for the 1st floor of the house. ', 'Amazing.  Really throws out a lot of heat.  Easy to set up, easy to use.  Cools off super fast too.  I use it on a front porch that has vinyl covers the open areas and open holes through the concrete base.  Maybe 100 square feet and on low it gets warm and toasty.  ', 'comes with wheels easy to install, and heat comes clean. tested with my CO (carbon monoxide) detector and is good for indoors. been using it on a rental property for couple days now. 3 settings for heat intensity. propane bottle doesnt go out as fast like other heaters.', ""This is a dyna-glo brand 6-18K BTU.3 burner panels knob controls 1,2,3 burner lighted.This would create 6,12,18k btu of heating output.Easy to setup with 20lb tank counter clockwise to tighten.Heats my 5-700 sq ft up to 70+ with 2 burners active in less /hr 50F ambient.Be safe with enclosed spaces with this, needs adequate ventilation.Have a carbon monoxide detector in airspace proximity.Doesn't produce much of a smell when burning, only during first few hours of being new."", ""this is my 3rd one, have one in my living room, one in family room. this one is just a backup. saw this advertised on five sights  3 said not for indoor use but others said that was just a disclaimer. i've used it indoors for 3 years with no problems.  i did disconnect the tipover device because it would not reset sometimes. great backup heating system"", ""This is a great heater. I have a 1500sq ft house that I heat with this heater and it will roast you out of the house. I usually run it on low and I put a little clamp on fan on top to push the heat out. The break in took awhile to burn off the new of it but after that there is no smell what so ever. It's easy to operate. I use it in the evening just to keep my electric bill down."", ""the buddy company makes one similar but this one makes the same heat it is a construction heater so not intended for use in your home(but that is just for the lawyers it is meant to heat a small area but one without clutter since items should be away from a 3 foot radius of 180 deg of the front the pilot lighting can be confusing for the stupid since you have to constantly hold down the pilot position for a few seconds then click the ignitor and leave it held down till the thermocouple heats which takes about 15 secondsso if you are a moron just buy an electric heateri heat my front room on setting 3 till it gets as warm as i like it  than outside then switch it to position 2 only complaints are the wheels don't roll well(yes i have the locking wheels unlocked)and the tank fitting is the old left hand  type instead of the easier to use new plastic (righty tighty)acme type that is on all propane tanks made after 1996also taking off and putting on the flimsy rear tank retainer is a bit annoying it would be better if it had a hinge and latch  instead of tabs and slots"", 'Needed something for back up heat due to our electricity being off frequently during storms and etc. This is an excellent source of quick and versatile heat. The ability to adjust from 6,000 to 18,000 BTUs makes it perfect. Build quality seems to be adequate. This is really a no brainer.', ""By every measure, this is wonderful heater. This heater quickly heats a 144 sqft room in 3-4 mins when using it at full capacity going from 40F to 70F. Excellent starting with the pilot light and it is easy to move (but the castors are probably not the greatest). At minimum capacity keeps an entire 2000sqft house from going below 62F when it is 22F outside (but this will also be dependent on air allowed in and insulation as well). Unlike electric, this gives off a pleasant infrared light that will heat things it is pointed at. This is quite nice since heated air is lighter than colder air and rises, but a chair or clothing 3-10ft away will warm from the light emissions. You can sit 3 ft away from it and warm your hands as if it was a camp fire from this light. You can also feel the hot air going straight up into the air.  Make sure you keep clear of the grill as in loose clothes or your leg. Also according to directions you are not suppose to leave it on unattended. But, one of the first things we did was roast marshmallows using long metal rods. For s'mores, you can get the perfect golden marshmallow. (even though it's not marketed as a marshmallow toaster).Between medium-to-high quality, portability, cost efficiency, and the shear fact that it paid for itself in less than one month from switching away from heating with electricity, I give it five stars.  "", 'We have heat pumps in our house and on those really cold nights they just don’t do the trick. We got this heater just for a little extra warmth and we have been shocked on how easy and warm it is. I found out that we only need to run it on low because medium and height is way to much.

It took no time to heat up a couple rooms of a little trailer, and the heater was only on low!  At that setting a tank of propane should last around 14hrs.

It's very easy to use but be patient after installing the LP gas bottle. You will have to hold the button starer for 30-60 second to purge the fuel line of air before the gas actually starts flowing to the burner. Once purged it starts very quickly!"", 'It is a wonderful product.  It is very simple to operate and has an attractive design.  It burns very cleanly with only a faint smell of propane.  Even on the low setting, it warms a 300-ft. area very quickly.  I do not yet know how long a one-pound container of Propane will burn.   It also has a convenient carrying case that holds the heater unit and two one-pound bottles of Propane.  That makes it easy to store, and it takes up very little space. I give it five stars (out of a possible five).  We had an ice storm in Oklahoma last year that knocked out power for over a week; my little apartment was freezing.  With Mr. Heater in the closet, I feel safe and secure for the next power outage.', ""Well first of all I started out as a Coleman heater man and I didn't think no other propane heater brand could outdo the Coleman product but Mr heater portable buddy does with greater heat output. The only thing that Mr heater could improve on is a way to regulate the heat temperature. It's just low 4000 btu to high 9000 btu and that can get to hot in a small area. Other than that so far, I find it to be a very good propane heater. Won't be going back to Coleman. For one thing their heaters wear out fast."", ""i really like this heater,this is the second one i bought.. the first one is still working fine..i'm writing this review based on that one. it has worked flawlessly. i use it all the time on the boat, all winter..it's a 34 foot boat with a large cabin that i use all winter.10 mins and the chill is gone. in 30 mins we're opening coats and relaxing..a 1 lb tank lasts all night on high..have taken it camping this year.. kept us warm &amp; cozy.the downloaded pdf instruction manual says it's safe for indoor use..but there still a CO2 warning..as with any other fire producing device..haven't had any problems at all with it...although i did have to clean a spider web from the pilot light in the fall.. i took the entire thing apart jut to see how it works.. very simple to work on..and i checked on line for any replacement parts.. all of the parts are available and fairly cheap.that makes it totally fixable..the safety features work almost too well.. a bump and it shuts off.. never had the tip over safety needed, but it has been checked.new in the store for 95$.. bought it used for 65/w shipping.."", ""If you are considering to buy a portable gas heater, so it's the one you have been looking for. It's very safe, light, has posibility to connect to big tank and looks solid.It has few safety off switches: turn over, flame out and low oxygen (this one I wasn't able to find in any other device) so this means that you can use it almost anywhere. It is very light and it came with carycase with wich it is even more comfartable to have it with you. It use not that much propane compared to how much heat it gives. It has two working modes High an Low. so far I have noticed that it uses about 100 grams (3.5 ounces) per hour in High mode and I think that it might use more than twice in low mode. It gives sufient heat to heat a room of 140 feet. And if it is not enaugh for you it has it's biger version with twice more power.Though it gives a bit of odor, but it is not that much noticible.So as I said, if you are looking for portable gas heater it is the one."", ""I bought this heater to take along tent camping when I go to different hunting places throughout the state. The heater seems to be very dependable. It is easy to start and to stop. I have used other Mr. Heater brand heaters for several years and they hold up well. The size is correct for my needs and heats my space easily. The 1 pound bottle attaches easily and is removed easily. It's a great little heater. It is a bit larger than I expected, but that does not effect how I will use it."", ""The Buddy Heater is an excellent idea with some flaws. I use mine nearly every day of winter. A ceramic heater is perfect for indoor use. You don't have to worry about carbon monoxide gas, and if you crack a window, the oxygen won't deplete. I love my heater! However, the Buddy Heater is not engineered well. All gas and propane are saturated with a very stinky oil which smells like rotten eggs so you will recognize it when you smell it. The Buddy Heater's small tubing, which delivers the gas to the the pilot light and ceramic heater, will condense out this oil in cold weather. When the tube fills with oil to a certain point, oil will get to the pilot orifice tube; this tube has a special glass filled hole that meters the pilot flame. Once that clogs -no pilot flame. No pilot flame, no worky. Mr Heater will sell you another pilot and ignition set, but this does not address the oil sitting in the tube. It will clog even faster. I have tried to call them to encourage them to change the design, but they just ignore me. My solution, and it works, is to carefully take the back off, remove the pilot assembly, unscrew the pilot orifice and put a pipe cleaner through the supply line. I then take pliers and put the orifice piece over a torch flame and heat it until it is smoking; hot enough to burn out the oil. I put it back together and it will work for another 2 months, (everyday use) before it clogs again. I  tried buying their in-line filter, but it still clogs up. The oil molecules are small enough to get past the filter. So I recommend the heater, but it's a real hassle when it stops working on a cold night!"", ""Excellent for portability and heating. Easy to use and simple to clean.  The downside of portable heaters it the short heating time.. 3 hours on full... up to 8 hours on ... thrifty usage.  Let alone the high cost of propane items now.For a permanent long time use I recommend the Olympian series heaters for durability.. all metal. The buddy heaters are excellent tho with excellent components and durability.Don't drop em tho.. the thermocouple moves a bit and it'll shut off all the time if you do not know where to move it back to."", 'I already had a good experience with the Mr Heater MH9B since my dad had purchased 3 of these a few years ago for our various hunting shacks. Very pleased with the updated design making the lighting of the heater easier with the pilot ignitor built into the adjustment knob and the swivel connector for the propane tank is a nice feature. Did an excellent job heating my hunting blind and also the area in my garage where we processed our deer. Would strongly recommend this heater to anyone.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Once opened it was perfect, no scratches or dents.  The heater was received and installed in mid September and it worked great, quiet and smooth.  This week when we went to turn it on as the weather got colder, the fan spun up but made this awful clatter.  I took off the top but could not see anything that was causing the noise.

Broan 112 Kickspace Fan-Forced Wall Heater with Built-In Thermostat White,198.24, ,"[""The Broan 112 heater came just as advertised as an open box item.  Once opened it was perfect, no scratches or dents.  The heater was received and installed in mid September and it worked great, quiet and smooth.  This week when we went to turn it on as the weather got colder, the fan spun up but made this awful clatter.  I took off the top but could not see anything that was causing the noise.  Then the unit stopped altogether, the fan wouldn't start up and no heat was emitted.  This unit replaced the same model that we had for the last 6 to 7 years with no problems.  We really like the heater but we're upset that this unit did not work."", 'This is kick space heater replaced one of same model.

"Portable Propane Heater Indoor-Safe Odor-Free 18,000 BTU Outdoor Camping",197.99, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

It's quite and in a properly sized room very effective and efficient.   A properly sized room being in the 300 to 500 sq.ft. range.   It would be taxed to do a 1,000 sq.ft."", 'Reasonably easy to install, puts out decidedly more heat than my forced air wall furnace. Heats my 1000 sq ft easily. I have used a small version in my RV for years.', 'We bought a similar 30K ng heater in the Fall of 1999, as a hedge against Y2K.  Just in case, bc, with natural gas, you don’t need any electricity. Bottom line, we wore some of the parts out and it became a pain to fiddle with, didn’t heat evenly, you get the picture. It’s 20 years old and neede tweaking to make it work properly. I’m retired now and don’t want to fiddle with it anymore. Fast forward to March 2019, my Wife said, let’s see what a new one goes for, it was $70 cheaper than our 1999 model, starts instantly, heats way better, and with the newer style thermostatic controller, heats evenly. You can’t beat this new Ng 30,000 btu MR. HEATER. BTW, OUR HOUSE IS A 1850 sq ft tri-Level. As long as it stays above Zero, this thing can maintain 65 deg easily, even shutting off the flame occasionally. {!!WARNING!!} this non-vented, ng heater requires an outside air suppy!! We also mounted a carbon monoxide detector nearby in our family room. I hooked up our MR HEATER to the ng starter in our fireplace, that has an outside fresh air vent(not the flu).  This 30k Ng Mr. Heater is the best, very happy with this space heater. You cannot beat the price either, got it in 4 days free shipping, plus $10 extra off!', ""My 2nd Mr heater.

Comfort Zone CZ230ER Fan Heater 240V,199.0, ,"[""This replaced a 40 y/o unit that worked, but not well. Having the remote control makes temperature control much easier. The high mode provides instant heat when used and the guide vanes direct the flow well. I did replace the circuit breaker as this unit has a max draw of 31.4 amps (7500 watts)on high mode, and insured the wiring and connections were proper. It's below freezing outside and this unit cycles and maintains 63-68 degrees with a 72 degree setting. The area is an insulated 900 sqft and the temperature is read on the wall furthest from the unit. Until I get a better primary heat source this is a great unit to have till then."", ""The heater is built pretty tough, which is a good thing. I also found it easy to connect, which interestingly enough was more expensive for the materials than it was for the heater. Only problem is that it doesn't heat as well as advertised. It claimed to heat an area (uninsulated) that was 30x30. my garage is 25x35 so I figured that was basically the same thing. after running for an hour or more it only brought the temp up from 45* to about 52*. I guess that if I left it running all the time it would eventually gey there, but that was not what I was hoping for. Plus, those temps were only for the emediate area around the heater, the far end of the garage was still ice cold. In any account it is a good heater for the price. especially if you already have a place wired for it."", ""Havent used it yet, but looks nice. It's smaller than I thought but as long as it heats good then I'm ok with it. I was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the plug. Luckily I have an extra one. I will have it hooked up in a couple of days. Thanks. "", ""Installed in my 2 car garage, used the correct 8ga wire and double pole breaker. On high setting, it trips the breaker. Tried a different breaker, no luck. It doesn't heat the garage as well as I anticipated, but better than having no heater at all. I like the remote, it works well. Heater is quiet. Not impressed but whatever. I may end up moving it to my basement, where I believe it may work better. "", 'After researching different heater I found this to be the best deal, but the heat sensor is on the inside witch makes it shut off sooner than it should so I located it on the outside and it now works good. I also looked on youtube to see how to hook up 220w and found it to be really easy but make sure you use 8/3 wire and a 40amp double pull breaker for safety reasons. I have a 24x30 insulated garage with 8 foot ceilings and at 32 degrees it will heat up at about 10 degrees an hour and after a while when the heat is up a little bit it seems to heat up faster so I use my kerosene heater to speed things up a little and when it gets around 68 degrees this heater can maintain very easy. now just so you know I have 4 metal cars in my garage that retain cold air for quite a while so your garage might heat up faster depending what you have in it', ""I purchased this unit to replace my old one. The unit arrived very quickly. I think it took 4 days to get to me. Packaging was very stout, no damage to the unit. I did have a friend of mine help me install it but it wasn't really hard and could have done it in a pinch. Instructions were easy to read. I have a 25x25 sq ft shop, insulated to about R4 and this heater does a nice job of warming it with outside temps around around 32F. This unit is also nice in that I have a choice of hi or lo elements used to heat.I would recommend this and install it myself if I go to a larger building."", 'Great price, great size, easy to use', ""Not happy with this heater. First of all, the thermostat is not correct, as it is located INSIDE the heater where it stays hot. Must be set much much higher for desired temp. Second, and worst of all, when the heater switches ON or OFF, it makes a extremely loud BANG. Really disappointing for the price and would return it if it wasn't hard wired in. Regret buying the warranty, as I don't plan on keeping past it's first breakdown."", 'The temperature sensor is mounted in a way that the heater cuts off way before room temperature is reached.  Believe the sensor is getting reading from the case rather than ambient temperature.  ', 'Well Made. Easy to use. Shipping was fast, with damage. Easy to install. Easy to hang. Would highly recommend it if the square footage is right and it is insulated.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

- EdenPURE GEN3 1000 Quartz Infrared Portable Space Heater -,200.0,6 watchers,"[""No instructions so take pics of old one with wires attatched. Then hook up new one, need to bend an optical sensor middle of board before installing new board into front cover so Just bend like the old one, also make note of LEDs because they need to fit into their individual positions. Just bend like old ones as well. Before you re-install front panel back-on heater housing and have the board installed in the front panel, make sure all the font cover push buttons click on and release, in other words return to position once you have actuated them. My board had a slight bend in it and would not allow one of the push switches to actuate as it was jammed into actuated position and would not release due to the bend in the PCB of the board. I simply backed off two of the mounting screws allowing the PCB to float just a bit allowing the buttons to actuate and release like they should. Not a big deal in leaving the PCB a little loose as it will not be going anywhere once you complete the installation.At first I was a little disappointed with the cycling action of the heater once it was installed. But what I did not take into account was that the heater needed to cycle to sense the correct room temp for the new board and after 4-6hrsit was back working great. Don't be surprised if you show a different number of LEDs lit with the new board compared to your old one due to temp sensing differences from one board to the next.Overall I like these heaters. They work great to Supplement your houses main heat source. I have mine against an inside wall pointed toward my main entrance to the house. After owning it for about five years I know for a fact it is saving me $30-$40 per month depending on the price of home heating oil. When oil was 4.65per gal, I was saving well over $50-$60 a month. I live in Alaska for what its worth and it runs/cycles 12months out of every year, and might get turned totally off for a total of 2weeks out of those 12months."", ""EdenPure's first heater endorsed by Bob Villa.  They no longer make this model which is over ten years old.  This model is reliable and energy efficient and safe in the home.  It has rollers and can be moved from room to room is necessary.

So much for this newfangled blade system.-At #7 setting, you have to start compensating for fan noise by raising TV volume.So before you know it, now this room is very noisy. I have tinnitus and want to keep what's left of my hearing for as long as possible, so this fan isn't going to cut it. I could use it in a spare room, but would rather buy a $49 Costco fan for that, instead of this $240 overpriced unit that doesn't perform as well as the $49 fan.-I waited years to buy a Dyson product, because of the prohibitive price. After this experience, I'll go back to the cheaper units, as when they malfunction you just toss them, and buy another.

Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

At #9 speed, it is 64db-Old tower fan was at 15ft, Dyson fan is at 12ft. but only a fraction of air gets to me compared to old cheapie tower fan. So much for this newfangled blade system.-At #7 setting, you have to start compensating for fan noise by raising TV volume.So before you know it, now this room is very noisy. I have tinnitus and want to keep what's left of my hearing for as long as possible, so this fan isn't going to cut it. I could use it in a spare room, but would rather buy a $49 Costco fan for that, instead of this $240 overpriced unit that doesn't perform as well as the $49 fan.-I waited years to buy a Dyson product, because of the prohibitive price. After this experience, I'll go back to the cheaper units, as when they malfunction you just toss them, and buy another.

Dyna-Glo Portable Forced Air Heater- Propane- NEW,200.0, ,"[""I won a auction for two Dyna Glo 30k-60k heaters for 75.00 shipped . Obviously by reading the description they were returned to the store for some issue and they were. The thermocouple didnt work in either one which always goes out and i always bypass anyway. They only came with one hose and regulator so i ordered another one for 8 bucks shipped. After watching a 2 minute video ( because these were different then the one i already own) it took me about 10 minutes to bypass the thermocouple on each unit and attach both hoses. I hooked both of them to a propane tank and they both worked perfectly. So i got two like new heaters for $85.00 . I read a few post before i purchased that complained about the heaters not staying lit they should have assumed they had a issue by the listing and the fact they are returns from the store. By watching a 2 minute video they couls have fixed the heater and got a great deal. A brand new thermocouple doesn't cost but 10 bucks shipped if you wanted to fix it , i prefer to bypass it . I don't like having to hold the button in for 5 minutes untill it gets hot enough to run on its on. By bypassing the thermocouple it stays lit as soon as you light it . I'm not sure how you buy a product described as returned to store and leave a bad review because it doesn't work correctly . I would have bypassed the thermocouple even if mine did work correctly but i never would have assumed it worked fine. If you looking for a brand new product work a warranty go to Lowe's arw home depot. If you have a philip head screw driver handy and you are looking for a deal like i was these work great ."", 'Pretty Quiet per se. arrived Fast. Compact with good output. Your not heating a large space Quickly with this but.. it is great for maintaining the warmth after the larger space is up to temp. Using it in a 1000 Sq. Ft 14’ side wall shop as 3rd Heater the 2 larger Kerosene jets get it toasty I shut them off and just run this propane Heater! Works Great even in Single digits outside in an Insulated Shop.Would buy again if needed.', 'Bought this heater to help supplement heat in our large informal office. We are presently using an 80,000 BTU kerosene heater but the fumes were bothering us when it shuts off other than that it warmed the large office space very quickly and evenly.We wanted to use the Dyna Glo because it is propane hoping there will be far less fumes. While we were attempting to get the heater to stay lit it was producing heat but not nearly as much as the kero 80K would. Nor did the fan push the heat throughout the office space as fast. This is only 20K BTU less but it felt far less than that.We had to return the Dyna-Glo. Maybe we will get another one or something a bit better and pay a few dollars more.', ""It was not able to heat a one car garage on the highest setting, after about 3 hours of operating, temp. was the same inside/outside of building, could only feel the heat if standing directly 2 feet in front of it, also very loud, wouldn't recommend"", 'Very good quality of product especially for the low price.', 'A very good heater  light weight  and would buy again', 'good product for the money', 'Compact /puts out lots of heat /easy set up', 'It dos the job very well !

Comfort Zone CZ230ER Fan Heater,200.0, ,"[""This replaced a 40 y/o unit that worked, but not well. Having the remote control makes temperature control much easier. The high mode provides instant heat when used and the guide vanes direct the flow well. I did replace the circuit breaker as this unit has a max draw of 31.4 amps (7500 watts)on high mode, and insured the wiring and connections were proper. It's below freezing outside and this unit cycles and maintains 63-68 degrees with a 72 degree setting. The area is an insulated 900 sqft and the temperature is read on the wall furthest from the unit. Until I get a better primary heat source this is a great unit to have till then."", ""The heater is built pretty tough, which is a good thing. I also found it easy to connect, which interestingly enough was more expensive for the materials than it was for the heater. Only problem is that it doesn't heat as well as advertised. It claimed to heat an area (uninsulated) that was 30x30. my garage is 25x35 so I figured that was basically the same thing. after running for an hour or more it only brought the temp up from 45* to about 52*. I guess that if I left it running all the time it would eventually gey there, but that was not what I was hoping for. Plus, those temps were only for the emediate area around the heater, the far end of the garage was still ice cold. In any account it is a good heater for the price. especially if you already have a place wired for it."", ""Havent used it yet, but looks nice. It's smaller than I thought but as long as it heats good then I'm ok with it. I was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the plug. Luckily I have an extra one. I will have it hooked up in a couple of days. Thanks. "", ""Installed in my 2 car garage, used the correct 8ga wire and double pole breaker. On high setting, it trips the breaker. Tried a different breaker, no luck. It doesn't heat the garage as well as I anticipated, but better than having no heater at all. I like the remote, it works well. Heater is quiet. Not impressed but whatever. I may end up moving it to my basement, where I believe it may work better. "", 'After researching different heater I found this to be the best deal, but the heat sensor is on the inside witch makes it shut off sooner than it should so I located it on the outside and it now works good. I also looked on youtube to see how to hook up 220w and found it to be really easy but make sure you use 8/3 wire and a 40amp double pull breaker for safety reasons. I have a 24x30 insulated garage with 8 foot ceilings and at 32 degrees it will heat up at about 10 degrees an hour and after a while when the heat is up a little bit it seems to heat up faster so I use my kerosene heater to speed things up a little and when it gets around 68 degrees this heater can maintain very easy. now just so you know I have 4 metal cars in my garage that retain cold air for quite a while so your garage might heat up faster depending what you have in it', ""I purchased this unit to replace my old one. The unit arrived very quickly. I think it took 4 days to get to me. Packaging was very stout, no damage to the unit. I did have a friend of mine help me install it but it wasn't really hard and could have done it in a pinch. Instructions were easy to read. I have a 25x25 sq ft shop, insulated to about R4 and this heater does a nice job of warming it with outside temps around around 32F. This unit is also nice in that I have a choice of hi or lo elements used to heat.I would recommend this and install it myself if I go to a larger building."", 'Great price, great size, easy to use', ""Not happy with this heater. First of all, the thermostat is not correct, as it is located INSIDE the heater where it stays hot. Must be set much much higher for desired temp. Second, and worst of all, when the heater switches ON or OFF, it makes a extremely loud BANG. Really disappointing for the price and would return it if it wasn't hard wired in. Regret buying the warranty, as I don't plan on keeping past it's first breakdown."", 'The temperature sensor is mounted in a way that the heater cuts off way before room temperature is reached.  Believe the sensor is getting reading from the case rather than ambient temperature.  ', 'Well Made. Easy to use. Shipping was fast, with damage. Easy to install. Easy to hang. Would highly recommend it if the square footage is right and it is insulated.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Dyna-Glo RA18LPDG Portable Space Heater - Black,199.0, ,"['A bit smelly at the beginning due that the paint is burning. Smell will go away in the 1st week. The front grill (chromed) will turn dark a bit but that’s to be expected. Enough heat for a 4x6m room when usign Liquid Propane gas. I used Butane and it was amazingly efficient (you feel the heat even with the pilot! Not even a single burner) but butane is difficult to find where i live.Comes with gas regulator, ready for a left internal thread. Easy to operate and very light to move around the house. Planning to buy another one for the 1st floor of the house. ', 'Amazing.  Really throws out a lot of heat.  Easy to set up, easy to use.  Cools off super fast too.  I use it on a front porch that has vinyl covers the open areas and open holes through the concrete base.  Maybe 100 square feet and on low it gets warm and toasty.  ', 'comes with wheels easy to install, and heat comes clean. tested with my CO (carbon monoxide) detector and is good for indoors. been using it on a rental property for couple days now. 3 settings for heat intensity. propane bottle doesnt go out as fast like other heaters.', ""This is a dyna-glo brand 6-18K BTU.3 burner panels knob controls 1,2,3 burner lighted.This would create 6,12,18k btu of heating output.Easy to setup with 20lb tank counter clockwise to tighten.Heats my 5-700 sq ft up to 70+ with 2 burners active in less /hr 50F ambient.Be safe with enclosed spaces with this, needs adequate ventilation.Have a carbon monoxide detector in airspace proximity.Doesn't produce much of a smell when burning, only during first few hours of being new."", ""this is my 3rd one, have one in my living room, one in family room. this one is just a backup. saw this advertised on five sights  3 said not for indoor use but others said that was just a disclaimer. i've used it indoors for 3 years with no problems.  i did disconnect the tipover device because it would not reset sometimes. great backup heating system"", ""This is a great heater. I have a 1500sq ft house that I heat with this heater and it will roast you out of the house. I usually run it on low and I put a little clamp on fan on top to push the heat out. The break in took awhile to burn off the new of it but after that there is no smell what so ever. It's easy to operate. I use it in the evening just to keep my electric bill down."", ""the buddy company makes one similar but this one makes the same heat it is a construction heater so not intended for use in your home(but that is just for the lawyers it is meant to heat a small area but one without clutter since items should be away from a 3 foot radius of 180 deg of the front the pilot lighting can be confusing for the stupid since you have to constantly hold down the pilot position for a few seconds then click the ignitor and leave it held down till the thermocouple heats which takes about 15 secondsso if you are a moron just buy an electric heateri heat my front room on setting 3 till it gets as warm as i like it  than outside then switch it to position 2 only complaints are the wheels don't roll well(yes i have the locking wheels unlocked)and the tank fitting is the old left hand  type instead of the easier to use new plastic (righty tighty)acme type that is on all propane tanks made after 1996also taking off and putting on the flimsy rear tank retainer is a bit annoying it would be better if it had a hinge and latch  instead of tabs and slots"", 'Needed something for back up heat due to our electricity being off frequently during storms and etc. This is an excellent source of quick and versatile heat. The ability to adjust from 6,000 to 18,000 BTUs makes it perfect. Build quality seems to be adequate. This is really a no brainer.', ""By every measure, this is wonderful heater. This heater quickly heats a 144 sqft room in 3-4 mins when using it at full capacity going from 40F to 70F. Excellent starting with the pilot light and it is easy to move (but the castors are probably not the greatest). At minimum capacity keeps an entire 2000sqft house from going below 62F when it is 22F outside (but this will also be dependent on air allowed in and insulation as well). Unlike electric, this gives off a pleasant infrared light that will heat things it is pointed at. This is quite nice since heated air is lighter than colder air and rises, but a chair or clothing 3-10ft away will warm from the light emissions. You can sit 3 ft away from it and warm your hands as if it was a camp fire from this light. You can also feel the hot air going straight up into the air.  Make sure you keep clear of the grill as in loose clothes or your leg. Also according to directions you are not suppose to leave it on unattended. But, one of the first things we did was roast marshmallows using long metal rods. For s'mores, you can get the perfect golden marshmallow. (even though it's not marketed as a marshmallow toaster).Between medium-to-high quality, portability, cost efficiency, and the shear fact that it paid for itself in less than one month from switching away from heating with electricity, I give it five stars.  "", 'We have heat pumps in our house and on those really cold nights they just don’t do the trick. We got this heater just for a little extra warmth and we have been shocked on how easy and warm it is. I found out that we only need to run it on low because medium and height is way to much. Great product.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Dyna-Glo Portable Forced Air Heater- Propane- NEW,200.0, ,"[""I won a auction for two Dyna Glo 30k-60k heaters for 75.00 shipped . Obviously by reading the description they were returned to the store for some issue and they were. The thermocouple didnt work in either one which always goes out and i always bypass anyway. They only came with one hose and regulator so i ordered another one for 8 bucks shipped. After watching a 2 minute video ( because these were different then the one i already own) it took me about 10 minutes to bypass the thermocouple on each unit and attach both hoses. I hooked both of them to a propane tank and they both worked perfectly. So i got two like new heaters for $85.00 . I read a few post before i purchased that complained about the heaters not staying lit they should have assumed they had a issue by the listing and the fact they are returns from the store. By watching a 2 minute video they couls have fixed the heater and got a great deal. A brand new thermocouple doesn't cost but 10 bucks shipped if you wanted to fix it , i prefer to bypass it . I don't like having to hold the button in for 5 minutes untill it gets hot enough to run on its on. By bypassing the thermocouple it stays lit as soon as you light it . I'm not sure how you buy a product described as returned to store and leave a bad review because it doesn't work correctly . I would have bypassed the thermocouple even if mine did work correctly but i never would have assumed it worked fine. If you looking for a brand new product work a warranty go to Lowe's arw home depot. If you have a philip head screw driver handy and you are looking for a deal like i was these work great ."", 'Pretty Quiet per se. arrived Fast. Compact with good output. Your not heating a large space Quickly with this but.. it is great for maintaining the warmth after the larger space is up to temp. Using it in a 1000 Sq. Ft 14’ side wall shop as 3rd Heater the 2 larger Kerosene jets get it toasty I shut them off and just run this propane Heater! Works Great even in Single digits outside in an Insulated Shop.Would buy again if needed.', 'Bought this heater to help supplement heat in our large informal office. We are presently using an 80,000 BTU kerosene heater but the fumes were bothering us when it shuts off other than that it warmed the large office space very quickly and evenly.We wanted to use the Dyna Glo because it is propane hoping there will be far less fumes. While we were attempting to get the heater to stay lit it was producing heat but not nearly as much as the kero 80K would. Nor did the fan push the heat throughout the office space as fast. This is only 20K BTU less but it felt far less than that.We had to return the Dyna-Glo. Maybe we will get another one or something a bit better and pay a few dollars more.', ""It was not able to heat a one car garage on the highest setting, after about 3 hours of operating, temp. was the same inside/outside of building, could only feel the heat if standing directly 2 feet in front of it, also very loud, wouldn't recommend"", 'Very good quality of product especially for the low price.', 'A very good heater  light weight  and would buy again', 'good product for the money', 'Compact /puts out lots of heat /easy set up', 'It dos the job very well !

Comfort Zone CZ230ER Fan Heater,200.0, ,"[""This replaced a 40 y/o unit that worked, but not well. Having the remote control makes temperature control much easier. The high mode provides instant heat when used and the guide vanes direct the flow well. I did replace the circuit breaker as this unit has a max draw of 31.4 amps (7500 watts)on high mode, and insured the wiring and connections were proper. It's below freezing outside and this unit cycles and maintains 63-68 degrees with a 72 degree setting. The area is an insulated 900 sqft and the temperature is read on the wall furthest from the unit. Until I get a better primary heat source this is a great unit to have till then."", ""The heater is built pretty tough, which is a good thing. I also found it easy to connect, which interestingly enough was more expensive for the materials than it was for the heater. Only problem is that it doesn't heat as well as advertised. It claimed to heat an area (uninsulated) that was 30x30. my garage is 25x35 so I figured that was basically the same thing. after running for an hour or more it only brought the temp up from 45* to about 52*. I guess that if I left it running all the time it would eventually gey there, but that was not what I was hoping for. Plus, those temps were only for the emediate area around the heater, the far end of the garage was still ice cold. In any account it is a good heater for the price. especially if you already have a place wired for it."", ""Havent used it yet, but looks nice. It's smaller than I thought but as long as it heats good then I'm ok with it. I was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the plug. Luckily I have an extra one. I will have it hooked up in a couple of days. Thanks. "", ""Installed in my 2 car garage, used the correct 8ga wire and double pole breaker. On high setting, it trips the breaker. Tried a different breaker, no luck. It doesn't heat the garage as well as I anticipated, but better than having no heater at all. I like the remote, it works well. Heater is quiet. Not impressed but whatever. I may end up moving it to my basement, where I believe it may work better. "", 'After researching different heater I found this to be the best deal, but the heat sensor is on the inside witch makes it shut off sooner than it should so I located it on the outside and it now works good. I also looked on youtube to see how to hook up 220w and found it to be really easy but make sure you use 8/3 wire and a 40amp double pull breaker for safety reasons. I have a 24x30 insulated garage with 8 foot ceilings and at 32 degrees it will heat up at about 10 degrees an hour and after a while when the heat is up a little bit it seems to heat up faster so I use my kerosene heater to speed things up a little and when it gets around 68 degrees this heater can maintain very easy. now just so you know I have 4 metal cars in my garage that retain cold air for quite a while so your garage might heat up faster depending what you have in it', ""I purchased this unit to replace my old one. The unit arrived very quickly. I think it took 4 days to get to me. Packaging was very stout, no damage to the unit. I did have a friend of mine help me install it but it wasn't really hard and could have done it in a pinch. Instructions were easy to read. I have a 25x25 sq ft shop, insulated to about R4 and this heater does a nice job of warming it with outside temps around around 32F. This unit is also nice in that I have a choice of hi or lo elements used to heat.I would recommend this and install it myself if I go to a larger building."", 'Great price, great size, easy to use', ""Not happy with this heater. First of all, the thermostat is not correct, as it is located INSIDE the heater where it stays hot. Must be set much much higher for desired temp. Second, and worst of all, when the heater switches ON or OFF, it makes a extremely loud BANG. Really disappointing for the price and would return it if it wasn't hard wired in. Regret buying the warranty, as I don't plan on keeping past it's first breakdown."", 'The temperature sensor is mounted in a way that the heater cuts off way before room temperature is reached.  Believe the sensor is getting reading from the case rather than ambient temperature.  ', 'Well Made. Easy to use. Shipping was fast, with damage. Easy to install. Easy to hang.

Dyna-Glo RA18LPDG Portable Space Heater - Black,199.0, ,"['A bit smelly at the beginning due that the paint is burning. Smell will go away in the 1st week. The front grill (chromed) will turn dark a bit but that’s to be expected. Enough heat for a 4x6m room when usign Liquid Propane gas. I used Butane and it was amazingly efficient (you feel the heat even with the pilot! Not even a single burner) but butane is difficult to find where i live.Comes with gas regulator, ready for a left internal thread. Easy to operate and very light to move around the house. Planning to buy another one for the 1st floor of the house. ', 'Amazing.  Really throws out a lot of heat.  Easy to set up, easy to use.  Cools off super fast too.  I use it on a front porch that has vinyl covers the open areas and open holes through the concrete base.  Maybe 100 square feet and on low it gets warm and toasty.  ', 'comes with wheels easy to install, and heat comes clean. tested with my CO (carbon monoxide) detector and is good for indoors. been using it on a rental property for couple days now. 3 settings for heat intensity. propane bottle doesnt go out as fast like other heaters.', ""This is a dyna-glo brand 6-18K BTU.3 burner panels knob controls 1,2,3 burner lighted.This would create 6,12,18k btu of heating output.Easy to setup with 20lb tank counter clockwise to tighten.Heats my 5-700 sq ft up to 70+ with 2 burners active in less /hr 50F ambient.Be safe with enclosed spaces with this, needs adequate ventilation.Have a carbon monoxide detector in airspace proximity.Doesn't produce much of a smell when burning, only during first few hours of being new."", ""this is my 3rd one, have one in my living room, one in family room. this one is just a backup. saw this advertised on five sights  3 said not for indoor use but others said that was just a disclaimer. i've used it indoors for 3 years with no problems.  i did disconnect the tipover device because it would not reset sometimes. great backup heating system"", ""This is a great heater. I have a 1500sq ft house that I heat with this heater and it will roast you out of the house. I usually run it on low and I put a little clamp on fan on top to push the heat out. The break in took awhile to burn off the new of it but after that there is no smell what so ever. It's easy to operate. I use it in the evening just to keep my electric bill down."", ""the buddy company makes one similar but this one makes the same heat it is a construction heater so not intended for use in your home(but that is just for the lawyers it is meant to heat a small area but one without clutter since items should be away from a 3 foot radius of 180 deg of the front the pilot lighting can be confusing for the stupid since you have to constantly hold down the pilot position for a few seconds then click the ignitor and leave it held down till the thermocouple heats which takes about 15 secondsso if you are a moron just buy an electric heateri heat my front room on setting 3 till it gets as warm as i like it  than outside then switch it to position 2 only complaints are the wheels don't roll well(yes i have the locking wheels unlocked)and the tank fitting is the old left hand  type instead of the easier to use new plastic (righty tighty)acme type that is on all propane tanks made after 1996also taking off and putting on the flimsy rear tank retainer is a bit annoying it would be better if it had a hinge and latch  instead of tabs and slots"", 'Needed something for back up heat due to our electricity being off frequently during storms and etc. This is an excellent source of quick and versatile heat. The ability to adjust from 6,000 to 18,000 BTUs makes it perfect. Build quality seems to be adequate. This is really a no brainer.', ""By every measure, this is wonderful heater. This heater quickly heats a 144 sqft room in 3-4 mins when using it at full capacity going from 40F to 70F. Excellent starting with the pilot light and it is easy to move (but the castors are probably not the greatest). At minimum capacity keeps an entire 2000sqft house from going below 62F when it is 22F outside (but this will also be dependent on air allowed in and insulation as well). Unlike electric, this gives off a pleasant infrared light that will heat things it is pointed at. This is quite nice since heated air is lighter than colder air and rises, but a chair or clothing 3-10ft away will warm from the light emissions. You can sit 3 ft away from it and warm your hands as if it was a camp fire from this light. You can also feel the hot air going straight up into the air.  Make sure you keep clear of the grill as in loose clothes or your leg. Also according to directions you are not suppose to leave it on unattended. But, one of the first things we did was roast marshmallows using long metal rods. For s'mores, you can get the perfect golden marshmallow. (even though it's not marketed as a marshmallow toaster).Between medium-to-high quality, portability, cost efficiency, and the shear fact that it paid for itself in less than one month from switching away from heating with electricity, I give it five stars.  "", 'We have heat pumps in our house and on those really cold nights they just don’t do the trick. We got this heater just for a little extra warmth and we have been shocked on how easy and warm it is. I found out that we only need to run it on low because medium and height is way to much.
