AZ Patio Heaters Outdoor Patio Heater in Hammered Bronze,203.12, ,"['The heater was quick to put together. Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.  "", 'It came on time.  Easy to put together but the pilot won’t light. Very disappointing! I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.  If I can’t get it to light, I’m returning it.', ""I purchased it couple of years ago, but after couple of time using it, the heater wouldn't turn on!!! I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door. It didn’t come with the bolts for that but no problem a couple small nuts and bolts from my garage and it is awesome!', 'The Items are both working fine so far. My only issue is, one of the items was considerably damaged as you can see in the pictures.', 'Incredible bargain, and very well made. Hot! Hot! Hot1 The assembly is a bit challenging, but worth the effort.', 'As described, very well made, nice looking!', 'Great price.

Once opened it was perfect, no scratches or dents.  The heater was received and installed in mid September and it worked great, quiet and smooth.

"DAYTON 3VU36 Prtbl Elct Job/Grage Heatr,15-7/8""L,240V",203.78, ,"[""I'm currently on my 3rd Dayton  heater, all the same model, over two winters. Iuse it for heating an attached greenhouse with double pane glass, dimensions14 x 25' and a story and a half tall.  I live in Duluth, MN with temps thatcan easily get down to -20 to -30.  All that being said, the heater does a goodjob keeping the greenhouse at 60 degrees with temps -20.  The first one lastedonly weeks before a short circuiting (?) problem, and I exchanged for a new oneunder the one year warrenty.  The second one only lasted a few days on it's second winter when the heating element no longer functioned, though the fan still did run.  I exchanged that one under a Square Trade warrenty and so farit has worked well.  Keep in mind the heater runs on 220 volts, so depending onwhat you pay for electricity your monthly costs can add up.  I would alsorecommend keeping it out of very humid conditions, and I always remove it fromthe greenhouse when watering and for several hours after until the greenhousehas dried out a bit.  I think it would work very well for a garage or detachedbuilding.  Just don't know if it is as rugged as I would want, but perhaps things are built nowdays as being more disposable.  Regardless, I would make sure you have a warrenty to protect yourself."", 'I bought this little heater to heat my 24 x 24 semi-insulated workshop. The walls are insulated, but the ceiling is just 1/2 inch plywood with no insulation. When I first unpacked the Dayton 3VU36, I was skeptical because of its size. Boy was I fooled.First run - Garage temp was 34 degrees (23 degrees outside with ice on the ground). Within 15 minutes, there was an increase of 14 degrees in the shop area. At 30 minutes, there was an increase of 22 degrees total (shop temp 56 degrees).The noise level is no different that the little box fan that I run in the summer. Not bad at all.Overall, I am a little shocked as to how well it is actually working. I would definately recommend it to a friend or family member. However..... I think it might struggle a little if used in an uninsulated area.', 'Used more to dry the moisture out of the air after warming with a torpedo propane heater in my shop.  Good to use for small area as main heat. Quiet for a 220 heater.', 'If you are serious about heating, and I mean really heating, your garage or shop, then a 240 volt heater is the way to go.  The 110 volt cheap heaters only produce about 1500 watts on maximum.  This 240 volt heater produces 5600 watts.  You do the math! It is necessary to wire a 240 volt outlet into your system but worth the trouble.', 'love the Heater', 'works well for the price, we use it to keep a greenhouse above 60 degrees in the winter months with outside temps at or around 8 degrees. This does a good job and worth the $99 investment.', 'Good unit as a temporary (part time) heater. Used to heat a two stall garage space while working on a car.Does require an electricial to run a 220 service to plug in the heater.A little noisy but does throw heat.', ""I'm going into my fourth heater in 4 years.

Mr. Heater MH18B Propane Heater Red,203.33, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Comfort  7, 500-Watt Digital Fan-Forced Ceiling Mount Heater with Remote, Grey..",203.28, ,"[""This replaced a 40 y/o unit that worked, but not well. Having the remote control makes temperature control much easier. The high mode provides instant heat when used and the guide vanes direct the flow well. I did replace the circuit breaker as this unit has a max draw of 31.4 amps (7500 watts)on high mode, and insured the wiring and connections were proper. It's below freezing outside and this unit cycles and maintains 63-68 degrees with a 72 degree setting. The area is an insulated 900 sqft and the temperature is read on the wall furthest from the unit. Until I get a better primary heat source this is a great unit to have till then."", ""The heater is built pretty tough, which is a good thing. I also found it easy to connect, which interestingly enough was more expensive for the materials than it was for the heater. Only problem is that it doesn't heat as well as advertised. It claimed to heat an area (uninsulated) that was 30x30. my garage is 25x35 so I figured that was basically the same thing. after running for an hour or more it only brought the temp up from 45* to about 52*. I guess that if I left it running all the time it would eventually gey there, but that was not what I was hoping for. Plus, those temps were only for the emediate area around the heater, the far end of the garage was still ice cold. In any account it is a good heater for the price. especially if you already have a place wired for it."", ""Havent used it yet, but looks nice. It's smaller than I thought but as long as it heats good then I'm ok with it. I was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the plug. Luckily I have an extra one. I will have it hooked up in a couple of days. Thanks. "", ""Installed in my 2 car garage, used the correct 8ga wire and double pole breaker. On high setting, it trips the breaker. Tried a different breaker, no luck. It doesn't heat the garage as well as I anticipated, but better than having no heater at all. I like the remote, it works well. Heater is quiet. Not impressed but whatever. I may end up moving it to my basement, where I believe it may work better. "", 'After researching different heater I found this to be the best deal, but the heat sensor is on the inside witch makes it shut off sooner than it should so I located it on the outside and it now works good. I also looked on youtube to see how to hook up 220w and found it to be really easy but make sure you use 8/3 wire and a 40amp double pull breaker for safety reasons. I have a 24x30 insulated garage with 8 foot ceilings and at 32 degrees it will heat up at about 10 degrees an hour and after a while when the heat is up a little bit it seems to heat up faster so I use my kerosene heater to speed things up a little and when it gets around 68 degrees this heater can maintain very easy. now just so you know I have 4 metal cars in my garage that retain cold air for quite a while so your garage might heat up faster depending what you have in it', ""I purchased this unit to replace my old one. The unit arrived very quickly. I think it took 4 days to get to me. Packaging was very stout, no damage to the unit. I did have a friend of mine help me install it but it wasn't really hard and could have done it in a pinch. Instructions were easy to read. I have a 25x25 sq ft shop, insulated to about R4 and this heater does a nice job of warming it with outside temps around around 32F. This unit is also nice in that I have a choice of hi or lo elements used to heat.I would recommend this and install it myself if I go to a larger building."", 'Great price, great size, easy to use', ""Not happy with this heater. First of all, the thermostat is not correct, as it is located INSIDE the heater where it stays hot. Must be set much much higher for desired temp. Second, and worst of all, when the heater switches ON or OFF, it makes a extremely loud BANG. Really disappointing for the price and would return it if it wasn't hard wired in. Regret buying the warranty, as I don't plan on keeping past it's first breakdown."", 'The temperature sensor is mounted in a way that the heater cuts off way before room temperature is reached.  Believe the sensor is getting reading from the case rather than ambient temperature.  ', 'Well Made. Easy to use. Shipping was fast, with damage. Easy to install. Easy to hang.

- EdenPURE GEN3 1000 Quartz Infrared Portable Space Heater -,200.0,6 watchers,"[""No instructions so take pics of old one with wires attatched. Then hook up new one, need to bend an optical sensor middle of board before installing new board into front cover so Just bend like the old one, also make note of LEDs because they need to fit into their individual positions. Just bend like old ones as well. Before you re-install front panel back-on heater housing and have the board installed in the front panel, make sure all the font cover push buttons click on and release, in other words return to position once you have actuated them. My board had a slight bend in it and would not allow one of the push switches to actuate as it was jammed into actuated position and would not release due to the bend in the PCB of the board. I simply backed off two of the mounting screws allowing the PCB to float just a bit allowing the buttons to actuate and release like they should. Not a big deal in leaving the PCB a little loose as it will not be going anywhere once you complete the installation.At first I was a little disappointed with the cycling action of the heater once it was installed. But what I did not take into account was that the heater needed to cycle to sense the correct room temp for the new board and after 4-6hrsit was back working great. Don't be surprised if you show a different number of LEDs lit with the new board compared to your old one due to temp sensing differences from one board to the next.Overall I like these heaters. They work great to Supplement your houses main heat source. I have mine against an inside wall pointed toward my main entrance to the house. After owning it for about five years I know for a fact it is saving me $30-$40 per month depending on the price of home heating oil. When oil was 4.65per gal, I was saving well over $50-$60 a month.

Dyna-Glo Portable Forced Air Heater- Propane- NEW,200.0, ,"[""I won a auction for two Dyna Glo 30k-60k heaters for 75.00 shipped . Obviously by reading the description they were returned to the store for some issue and they were. The thermocouple didnt work in either one which always goes out and i always bypass anyway. They only came with one hose and regulator so i ordered another one for 8 bucks shipped. After watching a 2 minute video ( because these were different then the one i already own) it took me about 10 minutes to bypass the thermocouple on each unit and attach both hoses. I hooked both of them to a propane tank and they both worked perfectly. So i got two like new heaters for $85.00 . I read a few post before i purchased that complained about the heaters not staying lit they should have assumed they had a issue by the listing and the fact they are returns from the store. By watching a 2 minute video they couls have fixed the heater and got a great deal. A brand new thermocouple doesn't cost but 10 bucks shipped if you wanted to fix it , i prefer to bypass it . I don't like having to hold the button in for 5 minutes untill it gets hot enough to run on its on. By bypassing the thermocouple it stays lit as soon as you light it . I'm not sure how you buy a product described as returned to store and leave a bad review because it doesn't work correctly . I would have bypassed the thermocouple even if mine did work correctly but i never would have assumed it worked fine. If you looking for a brand new product work a warranty go to Lowe's arw home depot. If you have a philip head screw driver handy and you are looking for a deal like i was these work great ."", 'Pretty Quiet per se. arrived Fast. Compact with good output. Your not heating a large space Quickly with this but.. it is great for maintaining the warmth after the larger space is up to temp. Using it in a 1000 Sq. Ft 14’ side wall shop as 3rd Heater the 2 larger Kerosene jets get it toasty I shut them off and just run this propane Heater! Works Great even in Single digits outside in an Insulated Shop.Would buy again if needed.', 'Bought this heater to help supplement heat in our large informal office. We are presently using an 80,000 BTU kerosene heater but the fumes were bothering us when it shuts off other than that it warmed the large office space very quickly and evenly.We wanted to use the Dyna Glo because it is propane hoping there will be far less fumes. While we were attempting to get the heater to stay lit it was producing heat but not nearly as much as the kero 80K would. Nor did the fan push the heat throughout the office space as fast. This is only 20K BTU less but it felt far less than that.We had to return the Dyna-Glo. Maybe we will get another one or something a bit better and pay a few dollars more.', ""It was not able to heat a one car garage on the highest setting, after about 3 hours of operating, temp. was the same inside/outside of building, could only feel the heat if standing directly 2 feet in front of it, also very loud, wouldn't recommend"", 'Very good quality of product especially for the low price.', 'A very good heater  light weight  and would buy again', 'good product for the money', 'Compact /puts out lots of heat /easy set up', 'It dos the job very well !

Mr. Heater Big Buddy Portable 18000 BTU Heater - Red,201.9,30-day returns,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.

Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter.

Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable.

It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.

Comfort Zone CZ230ER Fan Heater,200.0, ,"[""This replaced a 40 y/o unit that worked, but not well. Having the remote control makes temperature control much easier. The high mode provides instant heat when used and the guide vanes direct the flow well. I did replace the circuit breaker as this unit has a max draw of 31.4 amps (7500 watts)on high mode, and insured the wiring and connections were proper. It's below freezing outside and this unit cycles and maintains 63-68 degrees with a 72 degree setting. The area is an insulated 900 sqft and the temperature is read on the wall furthest from the unit. Until I get a better primary heat source this is a great unit to have till then."", ""The heater is built pretty tough, which is a good thing. I also found it easy to connect, which interestingly enough was more expensive for the materials than it was for the heater. Only problem is that it doesn't heat as well as advertised. It claimed to heat an area (uninsulated) that was 30x30. my garage is 25x35 so I figured that was basically the same thing. after running for an hour or more it only brought the temp up from 45* to about 52*. I guess that if I left it running all the time it would eventually gey there, but that was not what I was hoping for. Plus, those temps were only for the emediate area around the heater, the far end of the garage was still ice cold. In any account it is a good heater for the price. especially if you already have a place wired for it."", ""Havent used it yet, but looks nice. It's smaller than I thought but as long as it heats good then I'm ok with it. I was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the plug. Luckily I have an extra one. I will have it hooked up in a couple of days. Thanks. "", ""Installed in my 2 car garage, used the correct 8ga wire and double pole breaker. On high setting, it trips the breaker. Tried a different breaker, no luck. It doesn't heat the garage as well as I anticipated, but better than having no heater at all. I like the remote, it works well. Heater is quiet. Not impressed but whatever. I may end up moving it to my basement, where I believe it may work better. "", 'After researching different heater I found this to be the best deal, but the heat sensor is on the inside witch makes it shut off sooner than it should so I located it on the outside and it now works good. I also looked on youtube to see how to hook up 220w and found it to be really easy but make sure you use 8/3 wire and a 40amp double pull breaker for safety reasons. I have a 24x30 insulated garage with 8 foot ceilings and at 32 degrees it will heat up at about 10 degrees an hour and after a while when the heat is up a little bit it seems to heat up faster so I use my kerosene heater to speed things up a little and when it gets around 68 degrees this heater can maintain very easy. now just so you know I have 4 metal cars in my garage that retain cold air for quite a while so your garage might heat up faster depending what you have in it', ""I purchased this unit to replace my old one. The unit arrived very quickly. I think it took 4 days to get to me. Packaging was very stout, no damage to the unit. I did have a friend of mine help me install it but it wasn't really hard and could have done it in a pinch. Instructions were easy to read. I have a 25x25 sq ft shop, insulated to about R4 and this heater does a nice job of warming it with outside temps around around 32F. This unit is also nice in that I have a choice of hi or lo elements used to heat.I would recommend this and install it myself if I go to a larger building."", 'Great price, great size, easy to use', ""Not happy with this heater. First of all, the thermostat is not correct, as it is located INSIDE the heater where it stays hot. Must be set much much higher for desired temp. Second, and worst of all, when the heater switches ON or OFF, it makes a extremely loud BANG. Really disappointing for the price and would return it if it wasn't hard wired in. Regret buying the warranty, as I don't plan on keeping past it's first breakdown."", 'The temperature sensor is mounted in a way that the heater cuts off way before room temperature is reached.

Mr. Heater Big Buddy Portable 18000 BTU Heater - Red,201.9,30-day returns,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Comfort Zone CZ230ER Fan Heater,200.0, ,"[""This replaced a 40 y/o unit that worked, but not well. Having the remote control makes temperature control much easier. The high mode provides instant heat when used and the guide vanes direct the flow well. I did replace the circuit breaker as this unit has a max draw of 31.4 amps (7500 watts)on high mode, and insured the wiring and connections were proper. It's below freezing outside and this unit cycles and maintains 63-68 degrees with a 72 degree setting. The area is an insulated 900 sqft and the temperature is read on the wall furthest from the unit. Until I get a better primary heat source this is a great unit to have till then."", ""The heater is built pretty tough, which is a good thing. I also found it easy to connect, which interestingly enough was more expensive for the materials than it was for the heater. Only problem is that it doesn't heat as well as advertised. It claimed to heat an area (uninsulated) that was 30x30. my garage is 25x35 so I figured that was basically the same thing. after running for an hour or more it only brought the temp up from 45* to about 52*. I guess that if I left it running all the time it would eventually gey there, but that was not what I was hoping for. Plus, those temps were only for the emediate area around the heater, the far end of the garage was still ice cold. In any account it is a good heater for the price. especially if you already have a place wired for it."", ""Havent used it yet, but looks nice. It's smaller than I thought but as long as it heats good then I'm ok with it. I was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the plug. Luckily I have an extra one. I will have it hooked up in a couple of days. Thanks. "", ""Installed in my 2 car garage, used the correct 8ga wire and double pole breaker. On high setting, it trips the breaker. Tried a different breaker, no luck. It doesn't heat the garage as well as I anticipated, but better than having no heater at all. I like the remote, it works well. Heater is quiet. Not impressed but whatever. I may end up moving it to my basement, where I believe it may work better. "", 'After researching different heater I found this to be the best deal, but the heat sensor is on the inside witch makes it shut off sooner than it should so I located it on the outside and it now works good. I also looked on youtube to see how to hook up 220w and found it to be really easy but make sure you use 8/3 wire and a 40amp double pull breaker for safety reasons. I have a 24x30 insulated garage with 8 foot ceilings and at 32 degrees it will heat up at about 10 degrees an hour and after a while when the heat is up a little bit it seems to heat up faster so I use my kerosene heater to speed things up a little and when it gets around 68 degrees this heater can maintain very easy. now just so you know I have 4 metal cars in my garage that retain cold air for quite a while so your garage might heat up faster depending what you have in it', ""I purchased this unit to replace my old one. The unit arrived very quickly. I think it took 4 days to get to me. Packaging was very stout, no damage to the unit. I did have a friend of mine help me install it but it wasn't really hard and could have done it in a pinch. Instructions were easy to read. I have a 25x25 sq ft shop, insulated to about R4 and this heater does a nice job of warming it with outside temps around around 32F. This unit is also nice in that I have a choice of hi or lo elements used to heat.I would recommend this and install it myself if I go to a larger building."", 'Great price, great size, easy to use', ""Not happy with this heater. First of all, the thermostat is not correct, as it is located INSIDE the heater where it stays hot. Must be set much much higher for desired temp. Second, and worst of all, when the heater switches ON or OFF, it makes a extremely loud BANG. Really disappointing for the price and would return it if it wasn't hard wired in. Regret buying the warranty, as I don't plan on keeping past it's first breakdown."", 'The temperature sensor is mounted in a way that the heater cuts off way before room temperature is reached.  Believe the sensor is getting reading from the case rather than ambient temperature.  ', 'Well Made. Easy to use. Shipping was fast, with damage. Easy to install. Easy to hang. Would highly recommend it if the square footage is right and it is insulated.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

AZ Patio Heaters Outdoor Patio Heater,203.12, ,"['The heater was quick to put together. Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it.

Mr. Heater Big Buddy Portable 18000 BTU Heater - Red,201.9,30-day returns,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.

Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.

I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Comfort Zone CZ230ER Fan Heater,200.0, ,"[""This replaced a 40 y/o unit that worked, but not well. Having the remote control makes temperature control much easier. The high mode provides instant heat when used and the guide vanes direct the flow well. I did replace the circuit breaker as this unit has a max draw of 31.4 amps (7500 watts)on high mode, and insured the wiring and connections were proper. It's below freezing outside and this unit cycles and maintains 63-68 degrees with a 72 degree setting. The area is an insulated 900 sqft and the temperature is read on the wall furthest from the unit. Until I get a better primary heat source this is a great unit to have till then."", ""The heater is built pretty tough, which is a good thing. I also found it easy to connect, which interestingly enough was more expensive for the materials than it was for the heater. Only problem is that it doesn't heat as well as advertised. It claimed to heat an area (uninsulated) that was 30x30. my garage is 25x35 so I figured that was basically the same thing. after running for an hour or more it only brought the temp up from 45* to about 52*. I guess that if I left it running all the time it would eventually gey there, but that was not what I was hoping for. Plus, those temps were only for the emediate area around the heater, the far end of the garage was still ice cold. In any account it is a good heater for the price. especially if you already have a place wired for it."", ""Havent used it yet, but looks nice. It's smaller than I thought but as long as it heats good then I'm ok with it. I was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the plug. Luckily I have an extra one. I will have it hooked up in a couple of days. Thanks. "", ""Installed in my 2 car garage, used the correct 8ga wire and double pole breaker. On high setting, it trips the breaker. Tried a different breaker, no luck. It doesn't heat the garage as well as I anticipated, but better than having no heater at all. I like the remote, it works well. Heater is quiet. Not impressed but whatever. I may end up moving it to my basement, where I believe it may work better. "", 'After researching different heater I found this to be the best deal, but the heat sensor is on the inside witch makes it shut off sooner than it should so I located it on the outside and it now works good. I also looked on youtube to see how to hook up 220w and found it to be really easy but make sure you use 8/3 wire and a 40amp double pull breaker for safety reasons. I have a 24x30 insulated garage with 8 foot ceilings and at 32 degrees it will heat up at about 10 degrees an hour and after a while when the heat is up a little bit it seems to heat up faster so I use my kerosene heater to speed things up a little and when it gets around 68 degrees this heater can maintain very easy. now just so you know I have 4 metal cars in my garage that retain cold air for quite a while so your garage might heat up faster depending what you have in it', ""I purchased this unit to replace my old one. The unit arrived very quickly. I think it took 4 days to get to me. Packaging was very stout, no damage to the unit. I did have a friend of mine help me install it but it wasn't really hard and could have done it in a pinch. Instructions were easy to read. I have a 25x25 sq ft shop, insulated to about R4 and this heater does a nice job of warming it with outside temps around around 32F. This unit is also nice in that I have a choice of hi or lo elements used to heat.I would recommend this and install it myself if I go to a larger building."", 'Great price, great size, easy to use', ""Not happy with this heater. First of all, the thermostat is not correct, as it is located INSIDE the heater where it stays hot. Must be set much much higher for desired temp. Second, and worst of all, when the heater switches ON or OFF, it makes a extremely loud BANG. Really disappointing for the price and would return it if it wasn't hard wired in. Regret buying the warranty, as I don't plan on keeping past it's first breakdown."", 'The temperature sensor is mounted in a way that the heater cuts off way before room temperature is reached.  Believe the sensor is getting reading from the case rather than ambient temperature.  ', 'Well Made. Easy to use. Shipping was fast, with damage. Easy to install. Easy to hang.

Standing Propane Patio Heater Wheels Anti-tilt Hammered Adjustable Steel Bronze,208.49,Last item available,"['The heater was quick to put together. Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.

I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.

I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door.

" Mr Heater Big Buddy Portable Propane Radiant 3 Heat Settings Indoor 18,000 BTU",209.99,29 watchers,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.

Dyson AM04 Hot + Cool Heater/Table Fan,206.99,60-day returns,"[""Because of  a Great Price offer  so I thought Id try The Dyson AM04as I have nothing but praise for their Vacuum cleaners.   Its not big enough to really cool off a room and its too big to be a desk fan so just keep dimensions in mind when ordering.I like the fan as a Heater more then I like it as a Cool Fan but that's my opinion.I do like that its able to be both a hot and cool fan depending on time of year in one machine.if you think because its a dyson and its expensive you will get a Heater that Burns you or a Cool Fan that will Blast Artic air until you are content, you might be setting yourself up for disappointment.           If sheer Blasting power of either hot air or cool air is what you seek my opinion is Dyson falls Short and cheaper models are available, with more power.I enjoy the bladeless design and having both in one machine and for the price I'm happy!"", 'This product does a great job in a living room on those hot summer days and cold winter nights. The heating function works exceptionally well and automatically holds the room temperature. The fan operation is true to Dyson standards and creates a smooth calm flow of air throughout the room.

I am defiantly happy i purchased this second hand.', 'I have always wanted a Dyson hybrid fan and heater and when I saw an opportunity to get it for less than $300, even at refurbished condition, I had to just get it. It IS supposed to be refurbished by a Dyson certified dealer so I felt I could trust its condition to be satisfactory and safe. So far, the fan has been great in circulating air, albeit a little noisy even at its low setting, but it IS a fan and to be expected. I have not experienced using the heat setting yet, although I have tested it to be working so hopefully it will be sufficient for the winter months. Has a few dings, but its cosmetic and all I really care about is that it is safe to use, especially around children.', ""Dyson produces high quality products that can have a problem once in a while so the company reworks the product and sells it at a more attractive price.

Even on the the lowest fan setting it could be considered a good sleeping noise maker. As advertised mine did not come with a remote, but I ordered one off the Dyson website and it works perfectly. I'm a big fan of this fan. 4/5 stars only because it's a little louder than I expected, but aside from that I LOVE IT."", 'I also have a brand new version so I can compare versions that are 5 apart and honestly there is very little difference from one to the other.

" Mr Heater Big Buddy Portable Propane Radiant 3 Heat Settings Indoor 18,000 BTU",209.95,30-day returns,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

HILAND AZ Patio Heaters Bronze Patio Heater with Table 48K BTU,210.0, ,"['The heater was quick to put together. Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.  "", 'It came on time.  Easy to put together but the pilot won’t light. Very disappointing! I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.  If I can’t get it to light, I’m returning it.', ""I purchased it couple of years ago, but after couple of time using it, the heater wouldn't turn on!!! I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door. It didn’t come with the bolts for that but no problem a couple small nuts and bolts from my garage and it is awesome!', 'The Items are both working fine so far. My only issue is, one of the items was considerably damaged as you can see in the pictures.', 'Incredible bargain, and very well made. Hot! Hot!

But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!

"Mr. Heater Big Buddy 18,000 BTU/hr. 450 sq. ft. Radiant Propane Porta -Pack of 1",205.81, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

HILAND AZ Patio Heaters Bronze Patio Heater with Table 48K BTU,210.0, ,"['The heater was quick to put together. Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.  "", 'It came on time.  Easy to put together but the pilot won’t light. Very disappointing! I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.  If I can’t get it to light, I’m returning it.', ""I purchased it couple of years ago, but after couple of time using it, the heater wouldn't turn on!!! I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door. It didn’t come with the bolts for that but no problem a couple small nuts and bolts from my garage and it is awesome!', 'The Items are both working fine so far.

American Wick Kerosene Heater Wick -Case of 12,211.87, ,"['I got these wicks for my antique Perfection kerosene heaters (I bought several more to keep on hand after trying two). In my opinion, this wick actually out-performs the (new old stock) Perfection Brand wicks available for sale, which can be smelly from age, sometimes bent or rusted, and the cotton wick material, itself, tends to be a bit stiff from age, and occasionally are reconditioned or simply moved in the carrier to appear to be new when they are, in fact, used. I\'ve had that result twice from buying ""new"" old stock Perfection Brand wicks. This American Wick AW-500 fits perfectly, works smoothly, and is made with superior materials and craftsmanship. The wick is all cotton, heavy-duty and is long-lasting. It\'s clean-burning and there is no smoke or odor. The steel wick carrier is sturdy and smooth. Unlike the Perfection Brand wick, the American AW-500 is constructed with 4 splits in the lower part which go into the tank, creating 4 ""tails"" (NOTE: The lower portion of the wick is not visible in photo, as they are tucked inside its own cylindrical carrier in packaging, and in the photo). The American Wick AW-500 wick is very similar to the Perfection Brand 500 wick, but the Perfection  wick is split in 2 places and has 2 tails. In my opinion, the American AW-500 wick with 4 tails works better and is easier to install, because the 4-way tail split allows the wick tales to be more easily maneuvered around the wick adjuster, to seat a bit lower when turned down, and the tails to dip deeper into the kerosene tank and are more neatly adjusted up and down without binding at all. The cost of this item is very reasonable and I think it\'s a great value, compared with the usually higher-priced original Perfection 500 wicks to be found for sale. I hesitated at first to buy this non-Perfection part for my Perfection heaters, but after a couple of bad experiences with the more costly Perfection wicks, I am so glad I took the chance and bought the American AW-500 wicks! I\'m extremely pleased! I highly recommend this excellent product! ', ""These are not very heavy weight, the weave is loose, and they are not even close to the high quality brand name wick I order from England.  Cosmetically it's not nice looking as an original Perfection wick . Heavy metal wick sleeve is good and they are nicely fastened with metal riveting. They will work just fine in a Perfection 500 heater they just don't last as long as the other brand I buy and they will burn down a little bit faster.  If I can get a good deal on an AW-500 wick or this is the only one available it is much better than a fiberglass wick. Just make sure that you are gentle installing the wick and if one gets a lot of tar from contaminated fuel, moisture,  improper use,  and sticky in the wick gallery these will tear. Odor wise they will smell terrible when you burn one in for the first time that is normal because they are not pre charred. If you run at the highest flame setting possible in the Perfection 500  heater burning good quality kerosene they will do a good job. I use a Perfection 500 heater burning clear kerosene every day year round as my only source of heat and for cooking? If I can get a good deal on one or more of these AW500 wicks I will buy them.   "", 'Excellent quality.  AW-45 is lower part of a mechanical wick; AW-40 is the top part only; AW-49 is both top and bottom.  AW-45, as the bottom only, appears to be no longer available from wick manufacturers.  Grab them if you can find them!', 'Fits just as it should. Burns great in my Perfection M525 Heater. Will definitely buy again, although this one will last me for a few years.', 'Much better quality wick than even more expense wicks out there.  This one burns like the OEM all cotton wick with normal  charring as it should.  Other wicks I have used seem to have a high percentage of nylon or other synthetic and leave a hard residue after just one or two burns that is then hard to relight.  This wick has none of that and I will buy buy another just to have one hand. ', ""I was skeptical to purchase at first, considering they don't manufacture the Perfection Heaters anymore, but I took a chance and was very happy this wick is quite similar to an original Perfection wick, and it's 100% cotton. The only issue I experienced was that the gear holes on the wick canister didn't exactly line up correctly. Fortunately I was able to transfer the wick to the original wick canister which has gear holes all around it, making it much easier to install."", 'I had to get another one because it had burned down. When I forget to turn off the heater, the wick will burn down one quarter of an inch each time. I probably will be ordering another soon. Thanks for the product and price.', 'Heater is 100yrs. old, was easy to install,glad wick was still available.', 'These were great! I have two 50 year old vintage kerosene heater and these worked out perfectly!! I highly recommend these!', ""The next best thing to the 'Perfection' brand wick. Second one I bought.

HILAND AZ Patio Heaters Bronze Patio Heater with Table 48K BTU,210.0, ,"['The heater was quick to put together. Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.  "", 'It came on time.  Easy to put together but the pilot won’t light. Very disappointing! I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.  If I can’t get it to light, I’m returning it.', ""I purchased it couple of years ago, but after couple of time using it, the heater wouldn't turn on!!! I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door. It didn’t come with the bolts for that but no problem a couple small nuts and bolts from my garage and it is awesome!', 'The Items are both working fine so far.

American Wick Kerosene Heater Wick -Case of 12,211.87, ,"['I got these wicks for my antique Perfection kerosene heaters (I bought several more to keep on hand after trying two). In my opinion, this wick actually out-performs the (new old stock) Perfection Brand wicks available for sale, which can be smelly from age, sometimes bent or rusted, and the cotton wick material, itself, tends to be a bit stiff from age, and occasionally are reconditioned or simply moved in the carrier to appear to be new when they are, in fact, used. I\'ve had that result twice from buying ""new"" old stock Perfection Brand wicks. This American Wick AW-500 fits perfectly, works smoothly, and is made with superior materials and craftsmanship. The wick is all cotton, heavy-duty and is long-lasting. It\'s clean-burning and there is no smoke or odor. The steel wick carrier is sturdy and smooth. Unlike the Perfection Brand wick, the American AW-500 is constructed with 4 splits in the lower part which go into the tank, creating 4 ""tails"" (NOTE: The lower portion of the wick is not visible in photo, as they are tucked inside its own cylindrical carrier in packaging, and in the photo). The American Wick AW-500 wick is very similar to the Perfection Brand 500 wick, but the Perfection  wick is split in 2 places and has 2 tails. In my opinion, the American AW-500 wick with 4 tails works better and is easier to install, because the 4-way tail split allows the wick tales to be more easily maneuvered around the wick adjuster, to seat a bit lower when turned down, and the tails to dip deeper into the kerosene tank and are more neatly adjusted up and down without binding at all. The cost of this item is very reasonable and I think it\'s a great value, compared with the usually higher-priced original Perfection 500 wicks to be found for sale. I hesitated at first to buy this non-Perfection part for my Perfection heaters, but after a couple of bad experiences with the more costly Perfection wicks, I am so glad I took the chance and bought the American AW-500 wicks! I\'m extremely pleased! I highly recommend this excellent product! ', ""These are not very heavy weight, the weave is loose, and they are not even close to the high quality brand name wick I order from England.  Cosmetically it's not nice looking as an original Perfection wick . Heavy metal wick sleeve is good and they are nicely fastened with metal riveting. They will work just fine in a Perfection 500 heater they just don't last as long as the other brand I buy and they will burn down a little bit faster.  If I can get a good deal on an AW-500 wick or this is the only one available it is much better than a fiberglass wick. Just make sure that you are gentle installing the wick and if one gets a lot of tar from contaminated fuel, moisture,  improper use,  and sticky in the wick gallery these will tear. Odor wise they will smell terrible when you burn one in for the first time that is normal because they are not pre charred. If you run at the highest flame setting possible in the Perfection 500  heater burning good quality kerosene they will do a good job. I use a Perfection 500 heater burning clear kerosene every day year round as my only source of heat and for cooking? If I can get a good deal on one or more of these AW500 wicks I will buy them.   "", 'Excellent quality.  AW-45 is lower part of a mechanical wick; AW-40 is the top part only; AW-49 is both top and bottom.  AW-45, as the bottom only, appears to be no longer available from wick manufacturers.  Grab them if you can find them!', 'Fits just as it should. Burns great in my Perfection M525 Heater. Will definitely buy again, although this one will last me for a few years.', 'Much better quality wick than even more expense wicks out there.  This one burns like the OEM all cotton wick with normal  charring as it should.  Other wicks I have used seem to have a high percentage of nylon or other synthetic and leave a hard residue after just one or two burns that is then hard to relight.  This wick has none of that and I will buy buy another just to have one hand. ', ""I was skeptical to purchase at first, considering they don't manufacture the Perfection Heaters anymore, but I took a chance and was very happy this wick is quite similar to an original Perfection wick, and it's 100% cotton. The only issue I experienced was that the gear holes on the wick canister didn't exactly line up correctly. Fortunately I was able to transfer the wick to the original wick canister which has gear holes all around it, making it much easier to install."", 'I had to get another one because it had burned down. When I forget to turn off the heater, the wick will burn down one quarter of an inch each time. I probably will be ordering another soon. Thanks for the product and price.', 'Heater is 100yrs. old, was easy to install,glad wick was still available.', 'These were great! I have two 50 year old vintage kerosene heater and these worked out perfectly!! I highly recommend these!', ""The next best thing to the 'Perfection' brand wick. Second one I bought.

Once opened it was perfect, no scratches or dents.  The heater was received and installed in mid September and it worked great, quiet and smooth.  This week when we went to turn it on as the weather got colder, the fan spun up but made this awful clatter.  I took off the top but could not see anything that was causing the noise.  Then the unit stopped altogether, the fan wouldn't start up and no heat was emitted.  This unit replaced the same model that we had for the last 6 to 7 years with no problems.  We really like the heater but we're upset that this unit did not work."", 'This is kick space heater replaced one of same model. Worked well and quiet', 'Only issue is could be quieter', 'Product was advertised as 240 but was used and rewired to 120', 'the heater works great, but is a bit loud.  perfect otherwise', 'Work really great easily install heat great. Not a cheap built real tough. Not noisy at all. For a built in thermostat heat control is perfect.']","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.

HILAND AZ Patio Heaters Bronze Patio Heater with Table 48K BTU,210.0, ,"['The heater was quick to put together. Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.  "", 'It came on time.  Easy to put together but the pilot won’t light. Very disappointing! I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.

American Wick Kerosene Heater Wick -Case of 12,211.87, ,"['I got these wicks for my antique Perfection kerosene heaters (I bought several more to keep on hand after trying two). In my opinion, this wick actually out-performs the (new old stock) Perfection Brand wicks available for sale, which can be smelly from age, sometimes bent or rusted, and the cotton wick material, itself, tends to be a bit stiff from age, and occasionally are reconditioned or simply moved in the carrier to appear to be new when they are, in fact, used. I\'ve had that result twice from buying ""new"" old stock Perfection Brand wicks. This American Wick AW-500 fits perfectly, works smoothly, and is made with superior materials and craftsmanship. The wick is all cotton, heavy-duty and is long-lasting. It\'s clean-burning and there is no smoke or odor. The steel wick carrier is sturdy and smooth. Unlike the Perfection Brand wick, the American AW-500 is constructed with 4 splits in the lower part which go into the tank, creating 4 ""tails"" (NOTE: The lower portion of the wick is not visible in photo, as they are tucked inside its own cylindrical carrier in packaging, and in the photo). The American Wick AW-500 wick is very similar to the Perfection Brand 500 wick, but the Perfection  wick is split in 2 places and has 2 tails. In my opinion, the American AW-500 wick with 4 tails works better and is easier to install, because the 4-way tail split allows the wick tales to be more easily maneuvered around the wick adjuster, to seat a bit lower when turned down, and the tails to dip deeper into the kerosene tank and are more neatly adjusted up and down without binding at all. The cost of this item is very reasonable and I think it\'s a great value, compared with the usually higher-priced original Perfection 500 wicks to be found for sale. I hesitated at first to buy this non-Perfection part for my Perfection heaters, but after a couple of bad experiences with the more costly Perfection wicks, I am so glad I took the chance and bought the American AW-500 wicks! I\'m extremely pleased! I highly recommend this excellent product! ', ""These are not very heavy weight, the weave is loose, and they are not even close to the high quality brand name wick I order from England.  Cosmetically it's not nice looking as an original Perfection wick . Heavy metal wick sleeve is good and they are nicely fastened with metal riveting. They will work just fine in a Perfection 500 heater they just don't last as long as the other brand I buy and they will burn down a little bit faster.  If I can get a good deal on an AW-500 wick or this is the only one available it is much better than a fiberglass wick. Just make sure that you are gentle installing the wick and if one gets a lot of tar from contaminated fuel, moisture,  improper use,  and sticky in the wick gallery these will tear. Odor wise they will smell terrible when you burn one in for the first time that is normal because they are not pre charred. If you run at the highest flame setting possible in the Perfection 500  heater burning good quality kerosene they will do a good job. I use a Perfection 500 heater burning clear kerosene every day year round as my only source of heat and for cooking? If I can get a good deal on one or more of these AW500 wicks I will buy them.   "", 'Excellent quality.  AW-45 is lower part of a mechanical wick; AW-40 is the top part only; AW-49 is both top and bottom.  AW-45, as the bottom only, appears to be no longer available from wick manufacturers.  Grab them if you can find them!', 'Fits just as it should. Burns great in my Perfection M525 Heater. Will definitely buy again, although this one will last me for a few years.', 'Much better quality wick than even more expense wicks out there.  This one burns like the OEM all cotton wick with normal  charring as it should.  Other wicks I have used seem to have a high percentage of nylon or other synthetic and leave a hard residue after just one or two burns that is then hard to relight.  This wick has none of that and I will buy buy another just to have one hand. ', ""I was skeptical to purchase at first, considering they don't manufacture the Perfection Heaters anymore, but I took a chance and was very happy this wick is quite similar to an original Perfection wick, and it's 100% cotton. The only issue I experienced was that the gear holes on the wick canister didn't exactly line up correctly. Fortunately I was able to transfer the wick to the original wick canister which has gear holes all around it, making it much easier to install."", 'I had to get another one because it had burned down. When I forget to turn off the heater, the wick will burn down one quarter of an inch each time. I probably will be ordering another soon. Thanks for the product and price.', 'Heater is 100yrs. old, was easy to install,glad wick was still available.', 'These were great! I have two 50 year old vintage kerosene heater and these worked out perfectly!! I highly recommend these!', ""The next best thing to the 'Perfection' brand wick. Second one I bought.

HILAND AZ Patio Heaters Bronze Patio Heater with Table 48K BTU,210.0, ,"['The heater was quick to put together. Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.  "", 'It came on time.  Easy to put together but the pilot won’t light. Very disappointing! I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.  If I can’t get it to light, I’m returning it.', ""I purchased it couple of years ago, but after couple of time using it, the heater wouldn't turn on!!! I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door.

American Wick Kerosene Heater Wick -Case of 12,211.87, ,"['I got these wicks for my antique Perfection kerosene heaters (I bought several more to keep on hand after trying two). In my opinion, this wick actually out-performs the (new old stock) Perfection Brand wicks available for sale, which can be smelly from age, sometimes bent or rusted, and the cotton wick material, itself, tends to be a bit stiff from age, and occasionally are reconditioned or simply moved in the carrier to appear to be new when they are, in fact, used. I\'ve had that result twice from buying ""new"" old stock Perfection Brand wicks. This American Wick AW-500 fits perfectly, works smoothly, and is made with superior materials and craftsmanship. The wick is all cotton, heavy-duty and is long-lasting. It\'s clean-burning and there is no smoke or odor. The steel wick carrier is sturdy and smooth. Unlike the Perfection Brand wick, the American AW-500 is constructed with 4 splits in the lower part which go into the tank, creating 4 ""tails"" (NOTE: The lower portion of the wick is not visible in photo, as they are tucked inside its own cylindrical carrier in packaging, and in the photo). The American Wick AW-500 wick is very similar to the Perfection Brand 500 wick, but the Perfection  wick is split in 2 places and has 2 tails. In my opinion, the American AW-500 wick with 4 tails works better and is easier to install, because the 4-way tail split allows the wick tales to be more easily maneuvered around the wick adjuster, to seat a bit lower when turned down, and the tails to dip deeper into the kerosene tank and are more neatly adjusted up and down without binding at all. The cost of this item is very reasonable and I think it\'s a great value, compared with the usually higher-priced original Perfection 500 wicks to be found for sale. I hesitated at first to buy this non-Perfection part for my Perfection heaters, but after a couple of bad experiences with the more costly Perfection wicks, I am so glad I took the chance and bought the American AW-500 wicks! I\'m extremely pleased! I highly recommend this excellent product! ', ""These are not very heavy weight, the weave is loose, and they are not even close to the high quality brand name wick I order from England.  Cosmetically it's not nice looking as an original Perfection wick . Heavy metal wick sleeve is good and they are nicely fastened with metal riveting. They will work just fine in a Perfection 500 heater they just don't last as long as the other brand I buy and they will burn down a little bit faster.  If I can get a good deal on an AW-500 wick or this is the only one available it is much better than a fiberglass wick. Just make sure that you are gentle installing the wick and if one gets a lot of tar from contaminated fuel, moisture,  improper use,  and sticky in the wick gallery these will tear. Odor wise they will smell terrible when you burn one in for the first time that is normal because they are not pre charred. If you run at the highest flame setting possible in the Perfection 500  heater burning good quality kerosene they will do a good job. I use a Perfection 500 heater burning clear kerosene every day year round as my only source of heat and for cooking? If I can get a good deal on one or more of these AW500 wicks I will buy them.   "", 'Excellent quality.  AW-45 is lower part of a mechanical wick; AW-40 is the top part only; AW-49 is both top and bottom.  AW-45, as the bottom only, appears to be no longer available from wick manufacturers.  Grab them if you can find them!', 'Fits just as it should. Burns great in my Perfection M525 Heater. Will definitely buy again, although this one will last me for a few years.', 'Much better quality wick than even more expense wicks out there.  This one burns like the OEM all cotton wick with normal  charring as it should.  Other wicks I have used seem to have a high percentage of nylon or other synthetic and leave a hard residue after just one or two burns that is then hard to relight.  This wick has none of that and I will buy buy another just to have one hand. ', ""I was skeptical to purchase at first, considering they don't manufacture the Perfection Heaters anymore, but I took a chance and was very happy this wick is quite similar to an original Perfection wick, and it's 100% cotton. The only issue I experienced was that the gear holes on the wick canister didn't exactly line up correctly. Fortunately I was able to transfer the wick to the original wick canister which has gear holes all around it, making it much easier to install."", 'I had to get another one because it had burned down. When I forget to turn off the heater, the wick will burn down one quarter of an inch each time. I probably will be ordering another soon. Thanks for the product and price.', 'Heater is 100yrs. old, was easy to install,glad wick was still available.', 'These were great! I have two 50 year old vintage kerosene heater and these worked out perfectly!! I highly recommend these!', ""The next best thing to the 'Perfection' brand wick. Second one I bought.

Heating 1,800 sq feet? That's beyond optomistic, it's absurd. We set it up in our 25x15 living room and it can warm up that area if you leave it on for half the day.

I do have a 24000  ac with 18000   heat pump.  that I do turn on if it is real cold just to take the chill out of the room.   I an using the LS-1111HH13 infrared fireplace in a room about 20x35  around 700 sq. feet. and it keeps the room toasty.         Ray Phillips', ""I absolutely love this. I don't need the heater much here in Florida, but tried it once and it worked perfectly...very warm on my back porch. I use the fireplace setting every day and night. It is beautiful and realistic. There are cheaper ones out there, but research first. This one is fully assembled. Pull it out of the box and plug it in. It is real wood and on casters for easy movement. I want one for my living room as a tv stand but I don't have the money right now. Maybe next year. AAA brand."", ""Pros  price. Heat output is as expected.Lots of people complain it won't heat the 1800 sq ft home.Did you read the listing?Sets a mood without the mess of fire wood.Good for smaller rooms and such."", ""The description says this will heat up to 1800 sq ft. I didn't really expect to do that to be honest. 1800 sq. ft is a fairly large house. But this won't heat my small living room !. Bought it cheap so I guess I got what I paid for it. Would not recommend buying one except for maybe a SMALL bedroom."", ""Love, Love, Love it!  I have an old farmhouse that I use a fireplace to heat, this heater pulls heat from one end of my home to the other to keep an even temperature throughout.  I didn't think it was possible to not have to use space heaters but this one has taken the place of 4.  The cabinet it beautiful and the dogs have a second favorite place to sleep now, (the first is with me)."", ""I bought the fireplace/heater for  my daughter for Christmas. They loved it right off. Then they plugged it in and were more amazed by the way it heated their living room. Though it has not been very cold here,yet, they expect it to be a big help on their heating bill this year, They  also like the ambiance and glow it gives the room.  I don't believe I could have gotten them anything that would have suited them more for the price."", 'Received the Fireplace heats my room very well. I like the remote very easy to use. I would recommend this to my family and friends.', 'I love it! It looks good and heat a small area just fine. Using it keeps my electric bill low. I highly recommend any infrared heater.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it.

Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.  "", 'It came on time.  Easy to put together but the pilot won’t light. Very disappointing! I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.  If I can’t get it to light, I’m returning it.', ""I purchased it couple of years ago, but after couple of time using it, the heater wouldn't turn on!!! I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door. It didn’t come with the bolts for that but no problem a couple small nuts and bolts from my garage and it is awesome!', 'The Items are both working fine so far. My only issue is, one of the items was considerably damaged as you can see in the pictures.', 'Incredible bargain, and very well made. Hot! Hot! Hot1 The assembly is a bit challenging, but worth the effort.', 'As described, very well made, nice looking!', 'Great price.

- EdenPURE GEN3 1000 Quartz Infrared Portable Space Heater -nolonger in box,219.0,19 watchers,"[""No instructions so take pics of old one with wires attatched. Then hook up new one, need to bend an optical sensor middle of board before installing new board into front cover so Just bend like the old one, also make note of LEDs because they need to fit into their individual positions. Just bend like old ones as well. Before you re-install front panel back-on heater housing and have the board installed in the front panel, make sure all the font cover push buttons click on and release, in other words return to position once you have actuated them. My board had a slight bend in it and would not allow one of the push switches to actuate as it was jammed into actuated position and would not release due to the bend in the PCB of the board. I simply backed off two of the mounting screws allowing the PCB to float just a bit allowing the buttons to actuate and release like they should. Not a big deal in leaving the PCB a little loose as it will not be going anywhere once you complete the installation.At first I was a little disappointed with the cycling action of the heater once it was installed. But what I did not take into account was that the heater needed to cycle to sense the correct room temp for the new board and after 4-6hrsit was back working great. Don't be surprised if you show a different number of LEDs lit with the new board compared to your old one due to temp sensing differences from one board to the next.Overall I like these heaters. They work great to Supplement your houses main heat source. I have mine against an inside wall pointed toward my main entrance to the house. After owning it for about five years I know for a fact it is saving me $30-$40 per month depending on the price of home heating oil. When oil was 4.65per gal, I was saving well over $50-$60 a month. I live in Alaska for what its worth and it runs/cycles 12months out of every year, and might get turned totally off for a total of 2weeks out of those 12months."", ""EdenPure's first heater endorsed by Bob Villa.

Mr. Heater MH18B Propane Heater Red,215.75, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

DAYTON Portable Electric Jobsite  3VU36,215.73, ,"[""I'm currently on my 3rd Dayton  heater, all the same model, over two winters. Iuse it for heating an attached greenhouse with double pane glass, dimensions14 x 25' and a story and a half tall.  I live in Duluth, MN with temps thatcan easily get down to -20 to -30.  All that being said, the heater does a goodjob keeping the greenhouse at 60 degrees with temps -20.  The first one lastedonly weeks before a short circuiting (?) problem, and I exchanged for a new oneunder the one year warrenty.  The second one only lasted a few days on it's second winter when the heating element no longer functioned, though the fan still did run.  I exchanged that one under a Square Trade warrenty and so farit has worked well.  Keep in mind the heater runs on 220 volts, so depending onwhat you pay for electricity your monthly costs can add up.  I would alsorecommend keeping it out of very humid conditions, and I always remove it fromthe greenhouse when watering and for several hours after until the greenhousehas dried out a bit.  I think it would work very well for a garage or detachedbuilding.  Just don't know if it is as rugged as I would want, but perhaps things are built nowdays as being more disposable.  Regardless, I would make sure you have a warrenty to protect yourself."", 'I bought this little heater to heat my 24 x 24 semi-insulated workshop. The walls are insulated, but the ceiling is just 1/2 inch plywood with no insulation. When I first unpacked the Dayton 3VU36, I was skeptical because of its size. Boy was I fooled.First run - Garage temp was 34 degrees (23 degrees outside with ice on the ground). Within 15 minutes, there was an increase of 14 degrees in the shop area. At 30 minutes, there was an increase of 22 degrees total (shop temp 56 degrees).The noise level is no different that the little box fan that I run in the summer. Not bad at all.Overall, I am a little shocked as to how well it is actually working. I would definately recommend it to a friend or family member. However..... I think it might struggle a little if used in an uninsulated area.', 'Used more to dry the moisture out of the air after warming with a torpedo propane heater in my shop.  Good to use for small area as main heat. Quiet for a 220 heater.', 'If you are serious about heating, and I mean really heating, your garage or shop, then a 240 volt heater is the way to go.  The 110 volt cheap heaters only produce about 1500 watts on maximum.  This 240 volt heater produces 5600 watts.  You do the math! It is necessary to wire a 240 volt outlet into your system but worth the trouble.', 'love the Heater', 'works well for the price, we use it to keep a greenhouse above 60 degrees in the winter months with outside temps at or around 8 degrees. This does a good job and worth the $99 investment.', 'Good unit as a temporary (part time) heater. Used to heat a two stall garage space while working on a car.Does require an electricial to run a 220 service to plug in the heater.A little noisy but does throw heat.', ""I'm going into my fourth heater in 4 years.

Heating 1,800 sq feet? That's beyond optomistic, it's absurd. We set it up in our 25x15 living room and it can warm up that area if you leave it on for half the day. I probably would have been upset if I paid full retail and expected it to heat the entire 2,000 sq ft home. With that said, I paid roughly $120 for this unit refurbished (looks and acts good as new) and still thinks it's well worth it.

Though it has not been very cold here,yet, they expect it to be a big help on their heating bill this year, They  also like the ambiance and glow it gives the room.  I don't believe I could have gotten them anything that would have suited them more for the price."", 'Received the Fireplace heats my room very well. I like the remote very easy to use.

Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.

I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.

I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door.

- EdenPURE GEN3 1000 Quartz Infrared Portable Space Heater -nolonger in box,219.0,19 watchers,"[""No instructions so take pics of old one with wires attatched. Then hook up new one, need to bend an optical sensor middle of board before installing new board into front cover so Just bend like the old one, also make note of LEDs because they need to fit into their individual positions. Just bend like old ones as well. Before you re-install front panel back-on heater housing and have the board installed in the front panel, make sure all the font cover push buttons click on and release, in other words return to position once you have actuated them. My board had a slight bend in it and would not allow one of the push switches to actuate as it was jammed into actuated position and would not release due to the bend in the PCB of the board. I simply backed off two of the mounting screws allowing the PCB to float just a bit allowing the buttons to actuate and release like they should. Not a big deal in leaving the PCB a little loose as it will not be going anywhere once you complete the installation.At first I was a little disappointed with the cycling action of the heater once it was installed. But what I did not take into account was that the heater needed to cycle to sense the correct room temp for the new board and after 4-6hrsit was back working great. Don't be surprised if you show a different number of LEDs lit with the new board compared to your old one due to temp sensing differences from one board to the next.Overall I like these heaters. They work great to Supplement your houses main heat source. I have mine against an inside wall pointed toward my main entrance to the house. After owning it for about five years I know for a fact it is saving me $30-$40 per month depending on the price of home heating oil. When oil was 4.65per gal, I was saving well over $50-$60 a month. I live in Alaska for what its worth and it runs/cycles 12months out of every year, and might get turned totally off for a total of 2weeks out of those 12months."", ""EdenPure's first heater endorsed by Bob Villa.

Mr. Heater MH18B Propane Heater Red,215.75, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

DAYTON Portable Electric Jobsite  3VU36,215.73, ,"[""I'm currently on my 3rd Dayton  heater, all the same model, over two winters. Iuse it for heating an attached greenhouse with double pane glass, dimensions14 x 25' and a story and a half tall.  I live in Duluth, MN with temps thatcan easily get down to -20 to -30.  All that being said, the heater does a goodjob keeping the greenhouse at 60 degrees with temps -20.  The first one lastedonly weeks before a short circuiting (?) problem, and I exchanged for a new oneunder the one year warrenty.  The second one only lasted a few days on it's second winter when the heating element no longer functioned, though the fan still did run.  I exchanged that one under a Square Trade warrenty and so farit has worked well.  Keep in mind the heater runs on 220 volts, so depending onwhat you pay for electricity your monthly costs can add up.  I would alsorecommend keeping it out of very humid conditions, and I always remove it fromthe greenhouse when watering and for several hours after until the greenhousehas dried out a bit.  I think it would work very well for a garage or detachedbuilding.  Just don't know if it is as rugged as I would want, but perhaps things are built nowdays as being more disposable.  Regardless, I would make sure you have a warrenty to protect yourself."", 'I bought this little heater to heat my 24 x 24 semi-insulated workshop. The walls are insulated, but the ceiling is just 1/2 inch plywood with no insulation. When I first unpacked the Dayton 3VU36, I was skeptical because of its size. Boy was I fooled.First run - Garage temp was 34 degrees (23 degrees outside with ice on the ground). Within 15 minutes, there was an increase of 14 degrees in the shop area. At 30 minutes, there was an increase of 22 degrees total (shop temp 56 degrees).The noise level is no different that the little box fan that I run in the summer. Not bad at all.Overall, I am a little shocked as to how well it is actually working. I would definately recommend it to a friend or family member. However..... I think it might struggle a little if used in an uninsulated area.', 'Used more to dry the moisture out of the air after warming with a torpedo propane heater in my shop.  Good to use for small area as main heat. Quiet for a 220 heater.', 'If you are serious about heating, and I mean really heating, your garage or shop, then a 240 volt heater is the way to go.  The 110 volt cheap heaters only produce about 1500 watts on maximum.  This 240 volt heater produces 5600 watts.  You do the math! It is necessary to wire a 240 volt outlet into your system but worth the trouble.', 'love the Heater', 'works well for the price, we use it to keep a greenhouse above 60 degrees in the winter months with outside temps at or around 8 degrees. This does a good job and worth the $99 investment.', 'Good unit as a temporary (part time) heater. Used to heat a two stall garage space while working on a car.Does require an electricial to run a 220 service to plug in the heater.A little noisy but does throw heat.', ""I'm going into my fourth heater in 4 years. They only last a year or less and it's impossible to get parts. When they work, they're great. They just don't last.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"LifeSmart 1500 W Portable Electric Infrared Quartz Fireplace Heater, Indoor Use",219.00,30-day returns,"[""We're overall happy with this heater but you need to have realistic expectations. Heating 1,800 sq feet? That's beyond optomistic, it's absurd. We set it up in our 25x15 living room and it can warm up that area if you leave it on for half the day. I probably would have been upset if I paid full retail and expected it to heat the entire 2,000 sq ft home. With that said, I paid roughly $120 for this unit refurbished (looks and acts good as new) and still thinks it's well worth it. Quality: It's well built and a solid piece of furniture.Looks: The wood looks great and the flames are really nice. It defintely adds to the room."", ""I bought this heater thinking it would produce enough heat to atleast heat my living room which isn't to big but nope still cold it does look cool while it's on I will say that and also when I bought it, it arrived damaged now the company did offer me a partial refund which I got back part of my money but only because I've been through these situations before where you send an item back everyone drags their feet you wait forever to fix the initial problem so I just said ok and went with it but my honest opinion I would not buy another one not really worth it in my opinion."", 'I have been heating with a corn heater.  I really like the corn heater, but I am on o2 now and at times you have to open the door on the corn heater and you have an open flame. Open flame and o2  does nit work well with each other.  I do have a 24000  ac with 18000   heat pump.  that I do turn on if it is real cold just to take the chill out of the room.   I an using the LS-1111HH13 infrared fireplace in a room about 20x35  around 700 sq. feet. and it keeps the room toasty.         Ray Phillips', ""I absolutely love this. I don't need the heater much here in Florida, but tried it once and it worked perfectly...very warm on my back porch. I use the fireplace setting every day and night. It is beautiful and realistic. There are cheaper ones out there, but research first. This one is fully assembled. Pull it out of the box and plug it in. It is real wood and on casters for easy movement. I want one for my living room as a tv stand but I don't have the money right now. Maybe next year. AAA brand."", ""Pros  price. Heat output is as expected.Lots of people complain it won't heat the 1800 sq ft home.Did you read the listing?Sets a mood without the mess of fire wood.Good for smaller rooms and such."", ""The description says this will heat up to 1800 sq ft. I didn't really expect to do that to be honest. 1800 sq. ft is a fairly large house. But this won't heat my small living room !. Bought it cheap so I guess I got what I paid for it. Would not recommend buying one except for maybe a SMALL bedroom."", ""Love, Love, Love it!  I have an old farmhouse that I use a fireplace to heat, this heater pulls heat from one end of my home to the other to keep an even temperature throughout.  I didn't think it was possible to not have to use space heaters but this one has taken the place of 4.  The cabinet it beautiful and the dogs have a second favorite place to sleep now, (the first is with me)."", ""I bought the fireplace/heater for  my daughter for Christmas. They loved it right off. Then they plugged it in and were more amazed by the way it heated their living room. Though it has not been very cold here,yet, they expect it to be a big help on their heating bill this year, They  also like the ambiance and glow it gives the room.  I don't believe I could have gotten them anything that would have suited them more for the price."", 'Received the Fireplace heats my room very well. I like the remote very easy to use. I would recommend this to my family and friends.', 'I love it! It looks good and heat a small area just fine. Using it keeps my electric bill low.

Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.  "", 'It came on time.  Easy to put together but the pilot won’t light. Very disappointing! I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.  If I can’t get it to light, I’m returning it.', ""I purchased it couple of years ago, but after couple of time using it, the heater wouldn't turn on!!! I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door. It didn’t come with the bolts for that but no problem a couple small nuts and bolts from my garage and it is awesome!', 'The Items are both working fine so far.

- EdenPURE GEN3 1000 Quartz Infrared Portable Space Heater -nolonger in box,219.0,19 watchers,"[""No instructions so take pics of old one with wires attatched. Then hook up new one, need to bend an optical sensor middle of board before installing new board into front cover so Just bend like the old one, also make note of LEDs because they need to fit into their individual positions. Just bend like old ones as well. Before you re-install front panel back-on heater housing and have the board installed in the front panel, make sure all the font cover push buttons click on and release, in other words return to position once you have actuated them. My board had a slight bend in it and would not allow one of the push switches to actuate as it was jammed into actuated position and would not release due to the bend in the PCB of the board. I simply backed off two of the mounting screws allowing the PCB to float just a bit allowing the buttons to actuate and release like they should. Not a big deal in leaving the PCB a little loose as it will not be going anywhere once you complete the installation.At first I was a little disappointed with the cycling action of the heater once it was installed. But what I did not take into account was that the heater needed to cycle to sense the correct room temp for the new board and after 4-6hrsit was back working great. Don't be surprised if you show a different number of LEDs lit with the new board compared to your old one due to temp sensing differences from one board to the next.Overall I like these heaters. They work great to Supplement your houses main heat source. I have mine against an inside wall pointed toward my main entrance to the house. After owning it for about five years I know for a fact it is saving me $30-$40 per month depending on the price of home heating oil. When oil was 4.65per gal, I was saving well over $50-$60 a month. I live in Alaska for what its worth and it runs/cycles 12months out of every year, and might get turned totally off for a total of 2weeks out of those 12months."", ""EdenPure's first heater endorsed by Bob Villa.

Mr. Heater MH18B Propane Heater Red,215.75, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

DAYTON Portable Electric Jobsite  3VU36,215.73, ,"[""I'm currently on my 3rd Dayton  heater, all the same model, over two winters. Iuse it for heating an attached greenhouse with double pane glass, dimensions14 x 25' and a story and a half tall.  I live in Duluth, MN with temps thatcan easily get down to -20 to -30.  All that being said, the heater does a goodjob keeping the greenhouse at 60 degrees with temps -20.  The first one lastedonly weeks before a short circuiting (?) problem, and I exchanged for a new oneunder the one year warrenty.  The second one only lasted a few days on it's second winter when the heating element no longer functioned, though the fan still did run.  I exchanged that one under a Square Trade warrenty and so farit has worked well.  Keep in mind the heater runs on 220 volts, so depending onwhat you pay for electricity your monthly costs can add up.  I would alsorecommend keeping it out of very humid conditions, and I always remove it fromthe greenhouse when watering and for several hours after until the greenhousehas dried out a bit.  I think it would work very well for a garage or detachedbuilding.  Just don't know if it is as rugged as I would want, but perhaps things are built nowdays as being more disposable.  Regardless, I would make sure you have a warrenty to protect yourself."", 'I bought this little heater to heat my 24 x 24 semi-insulated workshop. The walls are insulated, but the ceiling is just 1/2 inch plywood with no insulation. When I first unpacked the Dayton 3VU36, I was skeptical because of its size. Boy was I fooled.First run - Garage temp was 34 degrees (23 degrees outside with ice on the ground). Within 15 minutes, there was an increase of 14 degrees in the shop area. At 30 minutes, there was an increase of 22 degrees total (shop temp 56 degrees).The noise level is no different that the little box fan that I run in the summer. Not bad at all.Overall, I am a little shocked as to how well it is actually working. I would definately recommend it to a friend or family member. However..... I think it might struggle a little if used in an uninsulated area.', 'Used more to dry the moisture out of the air after warming with a torpedo propane heater in my shop.  Good to use for small area as main heat. Quiet for a 220 heater.', 'If you are serious about heating, and I mean really heating, your garage or shop, then a 240 volt heater is the way to go.  The 110 volt cheap heaters only produce about 1500 watts on maximum.  This 240 volt heater produces 5600 watts.  You do the math! It is necessary to wire a 240 volt outlet into your system but worth the trouble.', 'love the Heater', 'works well for the price, we use it to keep a greenhouse above 60 degrees in the winter months with outside temps at or around 8 degrees. This does a good job and worth the $99 investment.', 'Good unit as a temporary (part time) heater. Used to heat a two stall garage space while working on a car.Does require an electricial to run a 220 service to plug in the heater.A little noisy but does throw heat.', ""I'm going into my fourth heater in 4 years. They only last a year or less and it's impossible to get parts. When they work, they're great. They just don't last.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"LifeSmart 1500 W Portable Electric Infrared Quartz Fireplace Heater, Indoor Use",219.00,30-day returns,"[""We're overall happy with this heater but you need to have realistic expectations. Heating 1,800 sq feet? That's beyond optomistic, it's absurd. We set it up in our 25x15 living room and it can warm up that area if you leave it on for half the day. I probably would have been upset if I paid full retail and expected it to heat the entire 2,000 sq ft home. With that said, I paid roughly $120 for this unit refurbished (looks and acts good as new) and still thinks it's well worth it. Quality: It's well built and a solid piece of furniture.Looks: The wood looks great and the flames are really nice. It defintely adds to the room."", ""I bought this heater thinking it would produce enough heat to atleast heat my living room which isn't to big but nope still cold it does look cool while it's on I will say that and also when I bought it, it arrived damaged now the company did offer me a partial refund which I got back part of my money but only because I've been through these situations before where you send an item back everyone drags their feet you wait forever to fix the initial problem so I just said ok and went with it but my honest opinion I would not buy another one not really worth it in my opinion."", 'I have been heating with a corn heater.  I really like the corn heater, but I am on o2 now and at times you have to open the door on the corn heater and you have an open flame. Open flame and o2  does nit work well with each other.  I do have a 24000  ac with 18000   heat pump.  that I do turn on if it is real cold just to take the chill out of the room.   I an using the LS-1111HH13 infrared fireplace in a room about 20x35  around 700 sq. feet. and it keeps the room toasty.         Ray Phillips', ""I absolutely love this. I don't need the heater much here in Florida, but tried it once and it worked perfectly...very warm on my back porch. I use the fireplace setting every day and night. It is beautiful and realistic. There are cheaper ones out there, but research first. This one is fully assembled. Pull it out of the box and plug it in. It is real wood and on casters for easy movement. I want one for my living room as a tv stand but I don't have the money right now. Maybe next year. AAA brand."", ""Pros  price. Heat output is as expected.Lots of people complain it won't heat the 1800 sq ft home.Did you read the listing?Sets a mood without the mess of fire wood.Good for smaller rooms and such."", ""The description says this will heat up to 1800 sq ft. I didn't really expect to do that to be honest. 1800 sq. ft is a fairly large house. But this won't heat my small living room !. Bought it cheap so I guess I got what I paid for it. Would not recommend buying one except for maybe a SMALL bedroom."", ""Love, Love, Love it!  I have an old farmhouse that I use a fireplace to heat, this heater pulls heat from one end of my home to the other to keep an even temperature throughout.  I didn't think it was possible to not have to use space heaters but this one has taken the place of 4.  The cabinet it beautiful and the dogs have a second favorite place to sleep now, (the first is with me)."", ""I bought the fireplace/heater for  my daughter for Christmas. They loved it right off. Then they plugged it in and were more amazed by the way it heated their living room. Though it has not been very cold here,yet, they expect it to be a big help on their heating bill this year, They  also like the ambiance and glow it gives the room.  I don't believe I could have gotten them anything that would have suited them more for the price."", 'Received the Fireplace heats my room very well. I like the remote very easy to use. I would recommend this to my family and friends.', 'I love it! It looks good and heat a small area just fine. Using it keeps my electric bill low.

Be careful when assembling the heat shield, it has sharp edges. After I assembled it, I attached an extra propane tank for my gas grill. I followed the simple lighting instructions and it fired right up. The cocktail table is a nice touch, but the ice in drinks will melt quickly with the amount of heat it gives off. The finish and appearance is very nice, I also bought a heater cover to protect it against the elements when it is not is use. The only complaint is, the door hatch for the propane storage is a little wonky when closing and securing it. Overall I highly recommend it.', ""It's a little harder to start than others we have used, but is large, nice looking, and cozy to hang out by! Puts off a lot of heat...recommend, though I have found others at better prices."", ""I had promised my wife a heater on the new porch ASAP.  There was nothing affordable local.  The big box stores had zero stock and no way to order.  Then I came across AZ Patio Heaters, asking a reasonable price for a 48KBtu heater.  Shipping was extraordinarily fast.  Package came with no dents.  Assembly relatively easy - I mean, there is some dexterity involved, but it wasn't difficult.  Unit immediately fired up.We'll be using it all winter into the spring.  "", 'It came on time.  Easy to put together but the pilot won’t light. Very disappointing! I’m going to see if I can get it serviced since I’m desperate to have a gas heater for outdoor use for my business.  If I can’t get it to light, I’m returning it.', ""I purchased it couple of years ago, but after couple of time using it, the heater wouldn't turn on!!! I only used it twice the first year, and it still looks nice but it doesn't work. I didn't realized that I had purchased the 3 year insurance online for it, so when I realized that I have insurance, I filed a claim to get it serviced or replaced, but insurance company was not very helpful, and asked to have it repaired at a certified repair shop, which I didn't find one in OC county, and the other option was to give 50% of the cost!! I rather they would sent a repairman to fix it or replace it!!"", 'This was easy to set up and works great! We had one minor issue and that was the latch for the door. It didn’t come with the bolts for that but no problem a couple small nuts and bolts from my garage and it is awesome!', 'The Items are both working fine so far.

- EdenPURE GEN3 1000 Quartz Infrared Portable Space Heater -nolonger in box,219.0,19 watchers,"[""No instructions so take pics of old one with wires attatched. Then hook up new one, need to bend an optical sensor middle of board before installing new board into front cover so Just bend like the old one, also make note of LEDs because they need to fit into their individual positions. Just bend like old ones as well. Before you re-install front panel back-on heater housing and have the board installed in the front panel, make sure all the font cover push buttons click on and release, in other words return to position once you have actuated them. My board had a slight bend in it and would not allow one of the push switches to actuate as it was jammed into actuated position and would not release due to the bend in the PCB of the board. I simply backed off two of the mounting screws allowing the PCB to float just a bit allowing the buttons to actuate and release like they should. Not a big deal in leaving the PCB a little loose as it will not be going anywhere once you complete the installation.At first I was a little disappointed with the cycling action of the heater once it was installed. But what I did not take into account was that the heater needed to cycle to sense the correct room temp for the new board and after 4-6hrsit was back working great. Don't be surprised if you show a different number of LEDs lit with the new board compared to your old one due to temp sensing differences from one board to the next.Overall I like these heaters. They work great to Supplement your houses main heat source. I have mine against an inside wall pointed toward my main entrance to the house. After owning it for about five years I know for a fact it is saving me $30-$40 per month depending on the price of home heating oil. When oil was 4.65per gal, I was saving well over $50-$60 a month. I live in Alaska for what its worth and it runs/cycles 12months out of every year, and might get turned totally off for a total of 2weeks out of those 12months."", ""EdenPure's first heater endorsed by Bob Villa.

Mr. Heater MH18B Propane Heater Red,215.75, ,"[""This heater is fairly large.  Don't expect it to fit under your legs in the bleachers.  The handle is really handy, but makes it pretty tall.This heater is very versatile. It can be like the smaller versions with just one element on at half power, full power, or both elements on full power.  It goes through propane about the same as all the other ones I've seen, and full power is a lot of power.  The fan (powered by D cells) blows warm air in your direction, which is nice because otherwise it just goes straight up.IMHO it's way handier than the smaller bottle mounted version because it doesn't tip easily and it's not as tall.  It puts the heat in a better location.It's not a small heater, but is powerful, well built, and looks like it will last."", 'this id the 2nd one I have owned  first one was 5 years old and used every day it was cold it keeps our coach warm enough on low  and very economicl to run do recomend getting the hose with regolator and using a 20 pound bbq grill tank outside  and keeping a couple of the one pound throw aways in reserve incase of a midnight run out of gas senero , teriffic for those emergencies and blizzards requires no electric to run just a couple batteries to run the fan but will still  produce  het with out fan not operating . has the o2 depletion piliot light that lifts off if o2 level gets to low plus tip switch incase it gets tipped over by accident , Like any heating device care should be taken to assure you are opperating it in a safe manner and following the instructions that states the clearences on ll sides ', 'Current house furnace is out and this unit has filled in amazingly well.  Live in MN and have 2 of these with a couple electric room heaters for 2000 sqft plus home and been heating for a month.  Do recommend the 20# Walmart propane tanks w/ gauge for $48 and conversion hose to unit for more economical heating that the small canisters.  CAn heat for nearly a week.  Have CO monitor and never have had it go off once.  They are made to be CO free .  We do not leave them running when not home for safety reason but never yet had an issue.  ', 'I bought this to be able to work in my 2 car garage during cold days. It works very well. The only drawback I could see is that the fan moves very little air. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star rating....  Made the garage able to be worked in with no jacket in about 2 hours (on a 15 degree day)  Well worth it...   And would be great thing to have if an ice storm hits and the power (heat) went out...  Costs less than a buck an hour worth of propane to run on High.  I bought a 15 lb tank and ran it for about 18 hours.....    I plan on getting a couple of portable 1 lb bottles and a refill adapter.....', 'Got Mr. Heater for a heater in my outside work area and as an emergency backup heater in case of power failure in a storm or the heat pump went bad in middle of winter. Works perfect and am using hooked up to 20lb propane tank and also little 1lb tanks. Either way is working perfect.  This thing will run you out of house on 18,000 btu setting.  Always vent from a window or door to keep oxygen fresh and will be good for indoor use, you will still be plenty warm and no worries about any pipes freezing. Great product', ""This little heater is just the ticket for quickly warming up our home on those chilly mornings. ,I live where we seldom get any colder than 40 degrees at night , we don't run any heater at night for safety reasons ,although I feel this heater is safer than any electric one , no cords to overheat . I turn it on in the morning and in 15 minutes the chill is taken off the house. I use a small fan to circulate the heat more than the one that comes with the heater which is efficient for one room.  I also purchased the 12 foot hose and regulator so I can hook to a 30 lbs bottle out side the house. just ran the hose through an existing tv cable  hole. I can get about a week of heat out of one bottle at 16.00 to refill. That is much cheaper than running electric space heaters."", ""The dogs and I have a very comfortable warm environment now that the heater is able to be used. They are so happy that the inside of the motorhome is a lot more comfortable. We have been having nights that are in the upper twenties and low 30s so we're really grateful to have a heater the prize this my cheat on low setting it it basically heats the Whole 30 ft motorhome it generates more than enough heat on low and will run for a hundred hours on that setting .  It is very warm at got my  farm in Coupeville Washington. thanks a lot for a great item!!"", 'I\'ve been hunting deer for 42 years now and never worried about the cold weather when I was younger, mostly because pop-up portable blinds and portable heaters like these were not available back then. But my youngest daughter started hunting with me 6 years ago and after watching her brave a particularly cold opening day her first year I decided there had to be a better setup so she could enjoy going with me and I could insure I would get to continue to enjoy spending such moments with her, so I bought my first ground blind and my first Mr. Heater Little Buddy heater, and closing weekend of rifle season was soooooo much more enjoyable. Having a heat source to warm our feet made all the difference in the world being able to sit beside my daughter and just watch her scan our surroundings for her first deer, and did she take a beauty! After realizing how great the difference in the experience having shelter and heat made, I broke down and bought blinds for my Dad, nephew, and great friend who owns the property where we hunt, and then decided everyone should be able to stay warm and enjoy their time in the field as well, so I retired my Little Buddy heater and bought three of the Buddy heaters and one of the heater/cooker models and stocked each blind with a heater. The difference between the Little Buddy and the bigger Buddy models is very noticeably different! Running the bigger Buddy heaters warmed up a two person ground blind sufficiently enough to allow us to take off our coats, even with several windows open, and sit comfortably without creating undue noise or alerts to the deer as we watched many feed and browse around in the field in front of us. Hunting went from a cold and trying event to a greatly enjoyed experience spending time with my daughter, my Dad, my nephew, and friend! I\'ve always said a bad day hunting or fishing is better than a good day working anytime, but having Mr. Heater Buddy heaters warming our ground blinds has made such a difference in our time spent together so much more enjoyable that now my oldest daughter is joining in, and that alone made any expense paid for the equipment one of my best investments! Funny story: My Dad was using the heater I put in the blind he was using and after spending the morning hunting we all went to breakfast and I asked him how well he liked having heat, and his reply was, ""great for about 20 minutes and then the damned thing quit and wouldn\'t re-light!"" I asked him if he had opened any windows and he said ""no, it wasn\'t light yet so I was just enjoying staying warm, until the heater went out!"" I started laughing and he was taken aback by my reaction and asked why I was laughing, had I played a joke and given him the junk heater? I said no and told him he should be thankful Mr. Heater saved his life! Not knowing what I was referring to he had a puzzled look on his face, so I told him that the heater has a low oxygen sensor built into it and because he had the windows closed up fresh air could not circulate through the blind and the heater shut off before he could pass out from carbon monoxide poisoning! The look on his face was priceless! All he could say was ""glad someone was looking out for him."" After breakfast and getting some chores done we all went back to our blinds and my Dad made sure he opened some windows and lit the heater, and spent the rest of the day happy and warm. Moral of the story: The safety features built into Mr. Heater heaters work! Excellent design, quality built, and smart safety features all make Mr. Heater heaters great products you can trust and that make experiences during cold weather so much more enjoyable, and if having one gets a friend or family member to join in the fun, that\'s money well spent! Not to mention having the added insurance of staying warm at home should the power go out for an extended period of time during cold weather!   So, that\'s my experience with Mr. Heater heaters, and I can and do highly recommend to anyone needing and looking for a quality and dependable portable small heater, get one. You will be glad you did! ', 'Due to recently power outage frequently, I brought this protable heater for indoor use for emergency. I did not have chance to try it for hour long but I did try and find out it is very practical make and workable. Only issue to me is I don’t aware it need 4 D battery to run and how long one will last.Any how it is a very good product,I highly recommend it.', ""Will be able to use it in my fish house, heat my area that I use for skinning and tanning the furs that I've trapped.  Like the fact that I can hook up to a larger propane tank.  The fan is a bonus and the 3 different heating levels are great also.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

DAYTON Portable Electric Jobsite  3VU36,215.73, ,"[""I'm currently on my 3rd Dayton  heater, all the same model, over two winters. Iuse it for heating an attached greenhouse with double pane glass, dimensions14 x 25' and a story and a half tall.  I live in Duluth, MN with temps thatcan easily get down to -20 to -30.  All that being said, the heater does a goodjob keeping the greenhouse at 60 degrees with temps -20.  The first one lastedonly weeks before a short circuiting (?) problem, and I exchanged for a new oneunder the one year warrenty.  The second one only lasted a few days on it's second winter when the heating element no longer functioned, though the fan still did run.  I exchanged that one under a Square Trade warrenty and so farit has worked well.  Keep in mind the heater runs on 220 volts, so depending onwhat you pay for electricity your monthly costs can add up.  I would alsorecommend keeping it out of very humid conditions, and I always remove it fromthe greenhouse when watering and for several hours after until the greenhousehas dried out a bit.  I think it would work very well for a garage or detachedbuilding.  Just don't know if it is as rugged as I would want, but perhaps things are built nowdays as being more disposable.  Regardless, I would make sure you have a warrenty to protect yourself."", 'I bought this little heater to heat my 24 x 24 semi-insulated workshop. The walls are insulated, but the ceiling is just 1/2 inch plywood with no insulation. When I first unpacked the Dayton 3VU36, I was skeptical because of its size. Boy was I fooled.First run - Garage temp was 34 degrees (23 degrees outside with ice on the ground). Within 15 minutes, there was an increase of 14 degrees in the shop area. At 30 minutes, there was an increase of 22 degrees total (shop temp 56 degrees).The noise level is no different that the little box fan that I run in the summer. Not bad at all.Overall, I am a little shocked as to how well it is actually working. I would definately recommend it to a friend or family member. However..... I think it might struggle a little if used in an uninsulated area.', 'Used more to dry the moisture out of the air after warming with a torpedo propane heater in my shop.  Good to use for small area as main heat. Quiet for a 220 heater.', 'If you are serious about heating, and I mean really heating, your garage or shop, then a 240 volt heater is the way to go.  The 110 volt cheap heaters only produce about 1500 watts on maximum.  This 240 volt heater produces 5600 watts.  You do the math! It is necessary to wire a 240 volt outlet into your system but worth the trouble.', 'love the Heater', 'works well for the price, we use it to keep a greenhouse above 60 degrees in the winter months with outside temps at or around 8 degrees. This does a good job and worth the $99 investment.', 'Good unit as a temporary (part time) heater. Used to heat a two stall garage space while working on a car.Does require an electricial to run a 220 service to plug in the heater.A little noisy but does throw heat.', ""I'm going into my fourth heater in 4 years. They only last a year or less and it's impossible to get parts. When they work, they're great. They just don't last.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

RARE VINTAGE - Victor Electric Products Inc. Metal Floor Heater H-1357 - TESTED,220.93,10 watchers,"[""I use this heater in my clinic and my patients absolutely love it. It's amazing how quickly it heats a room without air blasting or noise. It has a nice safety feature where it makes a horrible noise if it's tipping over (it only happens if I'm moving it when it's on). In fact several of my patients have gone out and bought their own for home. I should get a commission."", 'I have an old 1911 craftsman style house with no insulation.  My heating system is an outdated oil furnace.  As we all know the price of fuel is always fluctuating and seems like it is going to stay that way.  It costs me about $300.00 a month in the winter.  Which is ridiculous, especially when the heat just does not stay in the house for long.I needed a knew plan and changing out the heat system or insulating the house is not an option at this time.  So I went out and bought the presto heatdish.  It produces so much heat that during the winter I no longer had to heat the entire house to stay warm.  I would just carry the heatdish around with me, saving me hundreds of dollars month to month.  I had a few other electric heaters before I purchased this one and the difference is night and day.I  have had this heater for almost 3 years now and it still works as well as the day I purchased it.  It paid for itself in its first week work.  With as much use as this gets I would of expected it to burn out a while ago, but that is not the case.The drawbacks: It does not have an automatic turn off system if it were to fall over, but it does have an alarm that is unmistakably loud.   There is also a footlight that you cannot turn off or on, but you can just take out the lightbulb if that bothers you.Great product and highly recommended. Thanks for reading.', ""Proven, ancient technology that outperforms the daylights of newer, highly rated products. It's effective (heats the room quickly and thoroughly), efficient (only 1,000 watts), safe (automatic shut-off features), and built to last. Sometimes a product cannot be improved upon.  "", 'It gives off a good amount of heat but it has one big design flaw where the dish can not be tilted. This means the dish is in a fixed position which points into the air slightly. So if the surface you place it on is taller than you are while seated you will struggle to feel it. The safety tip over buzzer also prevents you from sliding something underneath it to tilt it yourself.', ""This is a wonderful heater.  I am a smoker and visit my family a lot.  I choose to smoke in the garage there and my sister in law bought this for me to use in the garage. It warms up quickly for the immediate area and it doesn't take long for the surrounding areas to warm up either. Once this gets going I don't even need a coat.  (Ohio area)  I have a house with very tall ceilings in the master bedroom and living area.  In the winter this little heater warms up quickly, even going right to the high setting.  I always have to turn it way back too.  I am widowed now and I don't need to keep the entire house warm, just where I am.  I do recommend this.  Oh, it is safe, if you move it at all when it is on you get a loud buzz sound!  If on the fence about it I would go with it."", 'Great price, lightweight, energy efficient. It has worked very well so far. The price was the best I found on Ebay. I think the design is very good. The shape of the dish plus the shiny interior helps it be much more efficient than a regular space heater. It gets very hot very fast. It also has a buzzer in case it tips over. A great all around heater to warm a person up fast.', ""These are fabulous heaters (radiant warmth, like the sun) and are in great condition.At first they didn't quite meet my needs, because I needed them to point straight ahead, whereas they are angled slightly upward and this is not adjustable. However, I set each heater on a slanted platform (which I made out of heavy cardboard), and now they meet my needs perfectly. (Parabolic heat dish heaters warm whatever is directly in front of them, within about, say, 15 feet.) You won't believe how much glowing warmth they put out!Also, Rob was great to do business with."", ""I live in a 1920's craftsman style house with poor insulation. This heater is wonderful and has allowed me to turn my thermostat down several degrees and still be comfortable here in Minnesota. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could because it is actually a little bit large to walk around in a small house with small rooms.  But that said, even set as low as it will go, it still puts out a lot of heat. In fact, I have to be careful not to put it in a room near my thermostat because the furnace will not come on at all if I do!  I have already recommended it to friends."", 'This heat dish pumps out heat so intensely it’s like a dryer for your cloths if sitting in front of it. I could feel it’s radiant heat from about 15ft away. Wayyyy better than other heat dish I had no contest. It does not oscillate and no remote only 2 features not on this probably because it is heavy duty. This is the best heat dish, look no further. ', ""I had a socially distanced bourbon tasting party for four on my back patio during January 2021 in Chicago. My neighbor had two of the Presto dishes so I ordered two more.

"2 Pack - Portable Buddy Heater, 4000/9000-BTU -F232050",224.73,Longtime member,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.

"【Dyson】""AM04 Hot + Cool Heater/Table Fan"" Good condition confirmed operation",224.0,Last item available,"[""Because of  a Great Price offer  so I thought Id try The Dyson AM04as I have nothing but praise for their Vacuum cleaners.   Its not big enough to really cool off a room and its too big to be a desk fan so just keep dimensions in mind when ordering.I like the fan as a Heater more then I like it as a Cool Fan but that's my opinion.I do like that its able to be both a hot and cool fan depending on time of year in one machine.if you think because its a dyson and its expensive you will get a Heater that Burns you or a Cool Fan that will Blast Artic air until you are content, you might be setting yourself up for disappointment.           If sheer Blasting power of either hot air or cool air is what you seek my opinion is Dyson falls Short and cheaper models are available, with more power.I enjoy the bladeless design and having both in one machine and for the price I'm happy!"", 'This product does a great job in a living room on those hot summer days and cold winter nights. The heating function works exceptionally well and automatically holds the room temperature. The fan operation is true to Dyson standards and creates a smooth calm flow of air throughout the room. I definitely am glad that i purchased this unit used since a new unit costs about $400. Way too much for a fan. I am defiantly happy i purchased this second hand.', 'I have always wanted a Dyson hybrid fan and heater and when I saw an opportunity to get it for less than $300, even at refurbished condition, I had to just get it. It IS supposed to be refurbished by a Dyson certified dealer so I felt I could trust its condition to be satisfactory and safe. So far, the fan has been great in circulating air, albeit a little noisy even at its low setting, but it IS a fan and to be expected. I have not experienced using the heat setting yet, although I have tested it to be working so hopefully it will be sufficient for the winter months. Has a few dings, but its cosmetic and all I really care about is that it is safe to use, especially around children.', ""Dyson produces high quality products that can have a problem once in a while so the company reworks the product and sells it at a more attractive price. I've had the hot and cool fan just a few weeks and it's working just fine. It's especially quiet, heats up and cools down quickly, and the remote makes it really easy to control. I also like not needing a separate fan and heater."", 'Fan works great, the remote makes it better. The heater is not as warm as most electric heaters, but will warm things if left on for a while. Saves having two separate devices. Was refurbished, but looks good and nicely packaged for shipment.', 'We used it on our sail boat.  So far just the summer.  It appears the heater works better than the cool.  but it is way better that not having!', ""This fan/heater moves a lot of air in fan mode, and heats up quickly (however it takes about 20 seconds for the heating element and fan to switch on once the heater is engaged).It's probably a little quieter than most fans that move this much air, but it's not as whisper quiet as the new Dyson models. Even on the the lowest fan setting it could be considered a good sleeping noise maker. As advertised mine did not come with a remote, but I ordered one off the Dyson website and it works perfectly. I'm a big fan of this fan. 4/5 stars only because it's a little louder than I expected, but aside from that I LOVE IT."", 'I also have a brand new version so I can compare versions that are 5 apart and honestly there is very little difference from one to the other. I think we should all keep that in mind when considering the possibility of getting a newer version.  It is amazing how close to each other they are in function. Truly amazing.', 'High quality materials, high performance.', ""I have wanted this Dyson fan for 6 years,but couldn't afford it. When I saw it on sale I didn't  hesitate and ordered  it.

"Dr Infrared Heater DR-122 Bedbug Heater with Thermometer and Timer, Big, Black",223.52,Last item available,"[""The unit was easy to assemble and we had it quickly up and running in 20 minutes. The quality of components and hardware is good and the instructions were easy to follow. The deciding factor in purchasing this unit was that it ran off of one 110v outlet. Other units that we looked at required multiple circuits (one required 4).In regard to negative feedback, it is nominal but the S clips that hold the center racks in place are very loose and it would be nice if Dr. Infrared would design them a little bit more rigid. The temp gauge/meter is of good quality but you need to understand that the timer counts back and not forward as to how long the unit has been on.We deal with bed bugs daily at our men's homeless shelter and it is so nice to take their belongings and quickly bake the little buggers out in under two hours. We are seriously thinking about getting a couple more tents in the near future."", ""Although I am grateful for a solution that doesn't cost thousands of dollars I have three complaints about this bed bug heater:1. The instructions are cursory, especially given how concerned most users will be to do things correctly, and the diagrams for assembly are faint. A link to a video would be great.2. The hooks to hold the shelves on WILL NOT fit in half the holes pre-drilled in the poles. And I mean WILL NOT with the force of two adults twisting and grunting in awkward physical positions. The holes are simply inadequately made. Note that I did get the other half in, so it is not that I cannot figure out how to do it, although a better diagram and an explanation would have helped see complaint #1.3. It takes HOURS to heat up to 120F and it's a really hot summer here! Would have been nice to know that. See #1.A minor disappointment is that the timer has no presets. A huge design bonus would be if the thermometre-timer could shut off the heater at the appropriate time.

It's only 12x12 but has very tall ceilings so I needed something that could heat the space adequately.  The unit is a lot smaller than I thought so that was a plus as it doesn't take up much room.You will need a 220V outlet which I had.  It doesn't heat the room super quick.  I usually turn it on 30 minutes before I'm going to work out there and it's good enough.  Can't expect much more from a unit so small.  The controls work well and so far it seems like a decent unit for the price."", ""I originally bought this to heat my wife's greenhouse replacing two milk house heaters.

I liked it so well I bought another one for my work shop."", 'THE PLUG ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT FIT INTO A STANDARD USA ELECTRICAL BOX ! ! ! !We really wanted the heater to be ready for the arrival of cold weather, and it was a huge shock to have to deal with re-fitting / re-placing the plug before we could get the heater and our Greenhouse ready.We had to competely replace the plug !     Once the plug had been replaced, it fit perfectly into our Electrician installed electrical box.The heater works really well, and we\'re very pleased with it.   However.... having to deal with a ""retro-fit"" before we could even get the heater plugged in was very disappointing, and caused quite a delay.', ""A lot better than milkbox heaters.

I considered the small propane table top heaters but my wife nixed that idea.  The typical outdoor 8 foot high propane heaters would have probably have drawn to much oxygen from the 13\' X 20\' sun room.  As I searched for other heating options, I came across this heater that stored a 20 lb. tank and made it look aesthetically pleasing.  It provides the right amount of heat for various atmospheric conditions!', 'We use the heater to supplement our fuel oil furnace. Works great to give a shot of heat while maintaining an overall lower temperature while we are gone', 'We got the heater shortly before Christmas 2017 here in Texas. Same day it arrived we had a freeze. Heater was installed in a converted barn and temp got up to about 75 in 15min or so. We have been using it for about a week now in below freezing temps with no issues other than it takes a few clicks to get the pilot to light. With all 3 burners going I pointed my temp gun at the front. My gun only goes to 1,000 deg and the heater is over that.', ""Great heater for my garage/workshop.  The heater puts out enough heat to warm up my 24' x x24' garage on a cold winters day (in Michigan).  With it's 3 settings (Lo, Med &amp; Hi) I start on Hi to raise the temp, then I set it to Lo to maintain temp.  I like the idea that the LP tank is built into the heater (instead of a separate tank and extension hose).  It makes the heater easy to roll around the shop and set it where the heat is needed.  I've had no issues with it not starting or operating properly.All in all, this is one great little portable heater.  I'd definitely but it again."", 'It is exactly what we needed. Works great and heats fast. Great product.', 'It is used every day sometimes three or four times to take the chill off in my 14 x 30 cabin. Fifteen min. or so is all it takes even when it is 12 fa outside. Wish I had it last year. Thanks Mr Heater !', ""I've had this heater for a month now and have used it in my garage. It works great in the garage even when it was 20 degrees outside. On high, I have to sit about 2 feet away or I start to get too hot. I normally turn it to medium setting once I start getting hot. It takes about 5 minutes to get up to full heat, and very minimum fumes.  I'm still using my first tank of gas! I love this heater!"", 'This heater holds a 20-pound propane tank. It does a good job of providing radiant heat. The pilot light ignites automatically, making the heater easy to use.

I considered the small propane table top heaters but my wife nixed that idea.  The typical outdoor 8 foot high propane heaters would have probably have drawn to much oxygen from the 13\' X 20\' sun room.  As I searched for other heating options, I came across this heater that stored a 20 lb. tank and made it look aesthetically pleasing.  It provides the right amount of heat for various atmospheric conditions!', 'We use the heater to supplement our fuel oil furnace. Works great to give a shot of heat while maintaining an overall lower temperature while we are gone', 'We got the heater shortly before Christmas 2017 here in Texas. Same day it arrived we had a freeze. Heater was installed in a converted barn and temp got up to about 75 in 15min or so. We have been using it for about a week now in below freezing temps with no issues other than it takes a few clicks to get the pilot to light. With all 3 burners going I pointed my temp gun at the front. My gun only goes to 1,000 deg and the heater is over that.', ""Great heater for my garage/workshop.  The heater puts out enough heat to warm up my 24' x x24' garage on a cold winters day (in Michigan).  With it's 3 settings (Lo, Med &amp; Hi) I start on Hi to raise the temp, then I set it to Lo to maintain temp.  I like the idea that the LP tank is built into the heater (instead of a separate tank and extension hose).  It makes the heater easy to roll around the shop and set it where the heat is needed.  I've had no issues with it not starting or operating properly.All in all, this is one great little portable heater.  I'd definitely but it again."", 'It is exactly what we needed. Works great and heats fast. Great product.', 'It is used every day sometimes three or four times to take the chill off in my 14 x 30 cabin. Fifteen min. or so is all it takes even when it is 12 fa outside. Wish I had it last year. Thanks Mr Heater !', ""I've had this heater for a month now and have used it in my garage. It works great in the garage even when it was 20 degrees outside. On high, I have to sit about 2 feet away or I start to get too hot. I normally turn it to medium setting once I start getting hot. It takes about 5 minutes to get up to full heat, and very minimum fumes.  I'm still using my first tank of gas! I love this heater!"", 'This heater holds a 20-pound propane tank.

"6,000 - 18,000 BTU Portable Radiant Propane Heater",281.95,30-day returns,"['I\'ve wrestled with the heating options for my sun room since my wife and daughter through out my ""old"" kerosene heaters.  I considered the small propane table top heaters but my wife nixed that idea.  The typical outdoor 8 foot high propane heaters would have probably have drawn to much oxygen from the 13\' X 20\' sun room.  As I searched for other heating options, I came across this heater that stored a 20 lb. tank and made it look aesthetically pleasing.  It provides the right amount of heat for various atmospheric conditions!', 'We use the heater to supplement our fuel oil furnace. Works great to give a shot of heat while maintaining an overall lower temperature while we are gone', 'We got the heater shortly before Christmas 2017 here in Texas. Same day it arrived we had a freeze. Heater was installed in a converted barn and temp got up to about 75 in 15min or so. We have been using it for about a week now in below freezing temps with no issues other than it takes a few clicks to get the pilot to light. With all 3 burners going I pointed my temp gun at the front. My gun only goes to 1,000 deg and the heater is over that.', ""Great heater for my garage/workshop.  The heater puts out enough heat to warm up my 24' x x24' garage on a cold winters day (in Michigan).  With it's 3 settings (Lo, Med &amp; Hi) I start on Hi to raise the temp, then I set it to Lo to maintain temp.  I like the idea that the LP tank is built into the heater (instead of a separate tank and extension hose).  It makes the heater easy to roll around the shop and set it where the heat is needed.  I've had no issues with it not starting or operating properly.All in all, this is one great little portable heater.  I'd definitely but it again."", 'It is exactly what we needed. Works great and heats fast. Great product.', 'It is used every day sometimes three or four times to take the chill off in my 14 x 30 cabin. Fifteen min. or so is all it takes even when it is 12 fa outside. Wish I had it last year. Thanks Mr Heater !', ""I've had this heater for a month now and have used it in my garage. It works great in the garage even when it was 20 degrees outside. On high, I have to sit about 2 feet away or I start to get too hot. I normally turn it to medium setting once I start getting hot. It takes about 5 minutes to get up to full heat, and very minimum fumes.  I'm still using my first tank of gas! I love this heater!"", 'This heater holds a 20-pound propane tank. It does a good job of providing radiant heat. The pilot light ignites automatically, making the heater easy to use. I am happy with it, although I have used it only three times so far.', 'fast shipping and heats up the area we needed it for quit fast', 'Works great, Gives off perfect amount of heat with the three settings.Recommended to anyone that is cold, and on a budget for heat.I first learned of these while in Greece in the navy. we used them over winter, where the climate was not so cold, but, you still needed something for quick heat to take the chill off.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).
