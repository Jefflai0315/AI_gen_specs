Now I live in az but we get some cold nights here and even have used indoors in larger part of house its not recommended since carbon monoxide poising can be a real threat. I reccomend thus product if your looking for good value and a trusted name.', 'This is the second one I have ordered. These work great and are easy to use.

This my second unit and they're durible and made to last. I highly recommend.Mike in Tucson"", 'Mr. Heater is the only way to go if you need a propane tank heater.  I bought two Harbor Freight heaters and had to return both of them because they either wouldn’t light or stay lit.  Mr. Heater installed easily, came with very simple instructions and started the first time.  Plus it’s very quiet!  I would highly recommend Mr. Heater and eBay easily had the best price.', ""Bought this basically as heat for the garage in case the power goes out, so my water lines don't freeze. I have used the heater a dozen times just testing it, while I messed around in the garage. Works exactly as the description said it would. No problems or issues as of now. Easy to install on the tank. Easy to light."", ""we use ours on a daily basis, and they typically fail within one year to 15 months. one of the safeties will malfunction, and the unit will either not produce any gas or will not stay lit. had to put a hose clamp around the startup plunger just to have heat, that brought it's useful life to almost 2 years. my mechanic has one that is maybe 10 years old that still works...it has no safeties. might as well buy the cheaper chinese ones and save money."", 'THIS IS A SAFETY IMPROVED UPGRADE OF THE ORIGINAL MR. HEATER AND IT ADDS A MOTION/TIP OVER SHUTOFF FEATURE .  SIZE IS COMPACT BUT THIS WORKS BEST WITH A 20 POUND TANK.  OUTPUT IS ROBUST AND OF A RADIANT NATURE THAT WORKS WELL FOR OUR DECK OFF-SEASON.   COMBUSTION IS NEAR COMPLETE FOR RARELY A WHIFF OF GAS.  ', 'This little heater works great, all week long using it in the evenings on low and only used 2.5 gal of propane. The only gripe would be the wire support bar thing is not the best design and the screw that holds it to the base of the heater is too short. For the price it is a good investment.', 'A small cook stove with a blue flame is good. This product is better. It has a lot of surface area and the flame can then burn hotter. I received it and am contemplating building something around it for safety.

"Mr. Heater 4,000-9000 BTU/ HR Propane Portable Buddy Heater, MH9BX",64.99, ,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","Used: An item that has been used previously.

Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,60.0, ,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly.

I always unplug it when not in use or leaving the apt.  Use a heavy duty extention cord that is not too long or else the cord may heat up.  No power down procedure - unit does not run fan to cool down.  Heat setting can be a little bizarre between temp and power.', 'Product came faster than expected, new, in original box.

Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit.

Newair portable oil filled heater AH400 Open Box,61.0, ,"[""A real case of caveat emptor. I obviously didn't lok too hard at the dimensions, as it's absolutely tiny. I grew up with electric oil-filled radiators that ran the length of a room, so find it odd it's so hard to find anything bigger of this shape. The metal seems thin, so I'm  not surprised others have complained of leaks developing. Again, I don't remember the ones I grew up with ever having a problem. It's sitting in a corner unused as I can't think where it's going to be useful. It might air the clothes in my cupboard, but as for heating anything larger, I don't see that happening."", 'It\'s in an important place in my chicken house operating very well.   We\'ll see how it does when temperature here in the American Midwest reaches 18 degrees below zero  I hae it ina small chicken house within an old milkshed that I\'m completing Styrofoam insulation, hopefully before winter sets in.  So far, the all is well with the temp down to 37 degrees a couple nights.   It is supplemented by two steady red heat lights and another thermostatically controlled heater by another manufacturer.  Meantime, pardon the ironic ""sweating an expected hard winter"" situation!   I do highly recommend this space heater and am sure it will work out for any close space.  Beats space heaters with hot elements hands down for safety.', 'Bought this heater in October. Have used it for a month inside a small bedroom (10 x 12 feet). Not an ideal heater for high heat needs. Eg. It helped the temp in the bedroom not drop so low that we wake up cold (was 28degF low this past week), however when set at its max heat setting all night long, the max temp inside room in the morning was 58-59F. So, not adequately warm. Our bedroom door was tightly shut and has only one window that is closed.Pros:Silent. Very light weight, so portable. Cuts off if tipped over even slightly at an angle or when knocked down to floor.Saves money on electricity!!Cons:Not adequate heating. Best heat if you stand right on top of it, between your legs :-)', 'This heater is light and slim.  It can fit in narrow spots however I would not recommend putting it in position that is close to other items.It is very hot and does NOT radiate heat like other oil heaters.  It is hot because the heat is not radiated out away from the heater.It does keep the ""chill"" of the bathroom however the cost of operating it may be higher than other radiator heaters.  I say this because more heat generation requires more electricity.I bought two of these and might put them in the trash because I don\'t know anyone I\'d want to bless with these ill-performing heaters.', ""I was looking for a small space heater for a back room in my house that doesn't benefit from the furnace heat.  The size of this heater is great, and it keeps the room at a nice even temperature. It's nice and compact. The one drawback I have found is the legs that accompany it are plastic, and over time the heat softens them, causing the heater to lean backward or forwards, which in my opinion is unsafe since it could possibly fall over. The effect of the heat on the legs is quite noticeable. The manufacturer should consider making the legs out of a material that is heat resistant."", 'i purchased the newair portable space heater for additional heat in main room.  my first oil filled heater.  it seems to making sounds like a hot water radiator, and the surface of heater is too hot.  will donate it to local charity', 'I have this in my bathroom to help with the cold in the morning.  My bathroom is small and it heats up the room in about 15 minutes.  Hot to the touch once it heats up so keep away from kids and pets to prevent burns.  Lightweight and thin to help minimize how much space it needs once set up.', 'This is exactly what we were looking for.  We use noisy forced-air heaters in the RV to ""take the chill off"".  So far, this unit is great.  It keeps the whole RV about 10-degrees above ambient, with no noise.  It is just 400-watt, so it will never keep up with a 1500W \'blowers\'.It is quite compact.ONE ISSUE.  The surface gets quite hot (~ 150-deg?).  It would not be a hazard to adults (they jump back!), but it would definitely need a shield around children.', ""It's great someonw makes a low wattage electric space heater for small spaces. None of the heaters we looked at went down farther than 600 watts"", 'It didn\'t perform as I was led to believe it would. I wasn\'t looking for something to go under my desk, but rather, a room heater. It\'s a great heater - as long as you\'re within 6"" of it - or closer. I love the thin profile and stylish looks of it. Instead of returning it, I chose to donate it to the animal shelter to either use or put into their annual yard sale which is a huge event. It will be my donation for this past Christmas (albeit late). I will get a space heater for my room some one of these days.']","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.

Even though the appearance of the current model is similar to the previous unit....it is an impressively improved design with new safety features...lights up very quickly and has an improved selector knob for the 3 different heat settings...', 'As far as the propane heater there are many choices but I be owned this same model unit not including new one I just purchased over 6 years and it HSS given me no problems for my outside heating needs. Now I live in az but we get some cold nights here and even have used indoors in larger part of house its not recommended since carbon monoxide poising can be a real threat. I reccomend thus product if your looking for good value and a trusted name.', 'This is the second one I have ordered. These work great and are easy to use. I highly recommend these to anyone who needs instant heat.', ""This is a great product! Well made with quality in mind. I especially like the tipover shutoff feature as it relates to safety. This my second unit and they're durible and made to last. I highly recommend.Mike in Tucson"", 'Mr. Heater is the only way to go if you need a propane tank heater.  I bought two Harbor Freight heaters and had to return both of them because they either wouldn’t light or stay lit.  Mr. Heater installed easily, came with very simple instructions and started the first time.  Plus it’s very quiet!  I would highly recommend Mr. Heater and eBay easily had the best price.', ""Bought this basically as heat for the garage in case the power goes out, so my water lines don't freeze. I have used the heater a dozen times just testing it, while I messed around in the garage. Works exactly as the description said it would. No problems or issues as of now. Easy to install on the tank. Easy to light."", ""we use ours on a daily basis, and they typically fail within one year to 15 months. one of the safeties will malfunction, and the unit will either not produce any gas or will not stay lit. had to put a hose clamp around the startup plunger just to have heat, that brought it's useful life to almost 2 years. my mechanic has one that is maybe 10 years old that still works...it has no safeties. might as well buy the cheaper chinese ones and save money."", 'THIS IS A SAFETY IMPROVED UPGRADE OF THE ORIGINAL MR. HEATER AND IT ADDS A MOTION/TIP OVER SHUTOFF FEATURE .  SIZE IS COMPACT BUT THIS WORKS BEST WITH A 20 POUND TANK.  OUTPUT IS ROBUST AND OF A RADIANT NATURE THAT WORKS WELL FOR OUR DECK OFF-SEASON.   COMBUSTION IS NEAR COMPLETE FOR RARELY A WHIFF OF GAS.  ', 'This little heater works great, all week long using it in the evenings on low and only used 2.5 gal of propane. The only gripe would be the wire support bar thing is not the best design and the screw that holds it to the base of the heater is too short. For the price it is a good investment.', 'A small cook stove with a blue flame is good. This product is better. It has a lot of surface area and the flame can then burn hotter. I received it and am contemplating building something around it for safety. The only thing like this is hot coals glowing in a wood fire.I have not yet made the thing I will construct around it so I have been unable to use it yet. By the time deep  winter is here I will have it made']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Am barely ever home and have someone living below me (I scavenge their heat).Oscillator is nice.  Set on something solid and elevated maybe a foot (table etc).  I always unplug it when not in use or leaving the apt.  Use a heavy duty extention cord that is not too long or else the cord may heat up.  No power down procedure - unit does not run fan to cool down.  Heat setting can be a little bizarre between temp and power.', 'Product came faster than expected, new, in original box. Quickly generates heat and warms a small room very well.  Thermostat allows heater to cycle on and off as needed to maintain the constant temperature needed for a greenhouse. Oscillating multiple temperature ranges are great features.', ""At first this heater smelled.  Once you get past that its great.  I've used Lasko products for years.  Its reliable and durable,  You get  a lot of features at an  affordable price.."", ""The best little heater. Throws alot of heat out. Warmed up the livingroom, dining area and kitchen to a nice warm comfortable temperature (couldn't believe it). It's very quiet, light weight, easy to set up and operate .. best part it's cool to touch! My little family is very happy with this heater. Will invest in another"", 'I bought this heater to replace a much larger, older quartz heater I used for the bathroom.  It is compact, has a nice design and provides a lot of heat quickly.  It is perfect for small rooms such as a bathroom.  No need to heat the whole house just to raise the warmth level in a single room when you can use a small room sized space heater like this Lasko Tower Heater.  The rotating feature is great for larger bathrooms; moves the heat around.   It was reasonably priced and arrived quickly.', 'I was using that brand that starts w/ a V. But they dont seem to last long. This one I noticed the temp was warmer then the other one, I like it. Keeps rooms toasty.', 'This small  heater heats the entire den! Very happy with it. I like the oscillating feature too. ', ""I finally caved this winter and purchased a heater to keep warm while I work from home. It's been amazing so far! Oscillation on the lowest setting warms my space surprisingly quickly. It's lightweight and I've experienced absolutely no electrical complications. I'm totally pleased with my purchase."", 'These work really well! Depending on the size of the room of course. I purchased this one for a small bedroom/office. Heats the room nice and toasty.

Comfort Zone Infrared Electric Heater 1500-Watt Thermostat Plastic Black,60.0,30-day returns,"[""This a very cost effective space heater to warm any area during a chilly winter, or - as we had during the early part of the Wisconsin spring - a slightly nippy start to spring. It works to warm a bedroom, normal sized living room (unsure of those with an open plan large setting), or a small area of a basement that you are working in. It has three settings, and has tip-over &amp; overheat protection. I like this product an awful lot, and thus I'll give it 4.5 stars. It does NOT have a remote, but I bought a separate one for that purpose. I am taking a half of a star off because EVEN though it does have tip over protection (meaning it shuts off in that case), it is slightly more easy to tip over than I thought it was. So if you have pets, it might NOT be the BEST idea to use it when they are out playing - NOT so much for safety sake, but to prevent your fur baby from getting injured stepping on it."", 'Works very well and set up takes only a few minutes...', ""This will be my last one.

Lasko 755320 Ceramic Space Tower Heater 8.5″L x 7.25″W x 23″H In Box W Remote,60.0, ,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit.

Mr. Heater Fuel Filter  Buddy Heaters F273699,65.00, ,"['This is the correct filter for using a hose with your Mr Heater. It filters oils that can come from the hose and any trash that might have found its way into hose. Arrived as advertised and ready to go.', ""Those little 1 lb. cylinders are great but if you want to heat for longer than a couple hours you'll find buying a 20 lb. propane tank, a long supply hose and a regulator a must.  My old Mr. Buddys used to work without a regulator but the new one I got wouldn't even light the pilot light without the regulator.  At any rate, I'm sitting warm and Mr. Buddy is working.  Do yourself a favor - even if you don't regularly use a big tank with Mr Buddy having the regulator and hose will give you peace of mind knowing should you need heat for a longer time you've got everything you need to stay warm.  It turns your propane heater from something you can use occasionally to knock the chill off into a heater you can depend on in an emergency."", 'Fuel filter kit matched up with my Mr. Heater without any issues. Works great.', ""I wish it weren't necessary to purchase these filters, because they are expensive and don't last particularly long.  However, they are absolutely necessary.  I learned the hard way with my first Mr. Buddy, which I ran with standard unfiltered propane canisters, which the Mr. Buddy is designed for.  In a season, the heater was hopelessly clogged and useless.  These filters will prevent that from happening.  The problem, unfortunately, is that, with the filters installed, standard canisters don't fit into the heater compartments that are designed to hold them.  The central promise of the Mr. Buddy—portability—is thus dead on arrival."", 'An excellent add-on to a Mr. Heater. Will keep the tiny orifice open and clear, if you are using a 20lbs propane tank. ', ""Have had a Big Buddy for several years as my space heater in the winter. Have always had this filter installed for protection. The filters aren't cheap, but you must have them as a blockage and the cleaning process thereafter is a pain. That's the only reason they are a good value."", 'This product came very fast and it really improve my tent heat performance. Before, I had trouble with the heater. Was hard to start and very hard to keep pilot fire lit. After installing it the pilot heats up fast and stays lit. Nice product, I bought two of them.

Lasko 224548 1500 W Ceramic Bathroom Heater,62.17, ,"[""I put this bathroom heater in my bedroom to compare with another good Lasko room heater of similar size and the same 1500 W but with different features. I like the angle of the heat blast from this bathroom heater better for when I'm sitting on my bed getting dressed in front of the heater, I am happier with the other in my office. which has a steeper angle of blast and a thermostat.I also use this bathroom heater in the bathroom for which it was intended. I wanted it above the sink level for safety, as there's nowhere else to put the heater but on the sink counter.  I  turned a fire safe small ceramic square kleenex holder upside down, and the heater's feet fit nicelyinside.This bathroom heater is convenient because of the one press button for a preset one hour of high heat for quick warmups such as in the bathroom or when getting dressed. No fussing with buttons. It also has High and Low settings that run without a timer.I also noticed that some sellers were saying their heaters were OK for the bathroom but the actual manufacturer did not.  This Bathroom heater is designed for the bathroom.  I'm not sure if the tripper in the cord is necessary if the outlet has one too, as many houses do these days in any water environment such as the bathroom or the kitchen.  I'm guessing the tripper in the plug reacts to the unit rather than the wall socket."", ""This heater does an excellent job of putting out a lot of air with the fan and also Heats the room excellently. For my application I'm using it in a fifth wheel trailer bathroom which is fairly small but one of the problems I'm having with the heater is I'm using a different thermostat on it that is more accurate to turn on and off and the heater shuts off and doesn't come back on when I use the thermostat on it so what you need to do is put something on the round button on top of the heater and tape it down to hold the button down all the time so that thermostat that I've got set up works properly and we'll kick the heater on when the temperature drops or more so when I want to heat the bathroom during a certain time of the day like when I take a shower.Otherwise the heater is an excellent heater and I would highly recommend anybody to buy it very good quality."", 'The heater is modern in design. It has a one hour feature that I love. I turn it on , shower get dressed in a warm bathroom, never have to wonder if I left it running. It automatically shuts off after 1 hour.', ""1. easy to turn on and off2. heats up fast3. has 1-hour auto shutoff4. very sturdy design, not likely to tip over5. made for humid areas like bathroomsbonus: it's cute!"", ""Here's the story:  To have my small bathroom warm when I get up in the morning for my shower, I had a small ceramic 1500 Watt heater connected into a wall timer to turn on automatically, and if I forgot (which I often did) to turn off automatically. With this Lasko heater, I tap the top when I'm ready to shower and it turns on high for one hour. Firstly, I don't have to remember to turn it off. Secondly, the velocity of the hot air coming out is so high that the bathroom heats up much quicker than my other heater, even though the wattage of both units is the same. This saves my electric bill.It seems to be good, quality wise, but it's only a month old now so we'll see.  November, 2020A note:  After it's turned off, and the top button (the big and only one) is tapped, it starts at the timed one hour 1500 Watt setting automatically."", ""It is difficult to find a space heater that is specifically for bathroom use. I was happy to find this one at this price and good reviews! It does exactly what I need it to do, I warm up my bathroom before a shower as my heat does not do that well - North side of house in Wisconsin! I will see how it holds up this winter, but so far very pleased with it's performance."", 'Works great! Instant heat . Small size is great. Comes with wet location plug  &amp; cord', ""Perfect replacement for my old heater that finally died. Small, lightweight, gets super warm in my little bathroom. Like that it's specifically made to use in a bathroom. Warming, the front grill can get hot!"", 'This little heater has all the power i need to heat up the bathroom in a hurry.

Lasko Space Heater with Tip-Over Safety Switch 1500W Automatic Air Flow Portable,60.54,30-day returns,"[""With the cold grip of a long winter making the house too chilly to stay comfortable, I looked for some space heaters to help out the central A/C system. After checking out just about all of the available products on the market, I spotted the Lasko 5812 heater on Ebay- the ONLY one I could find that directs warm air into the room from the bottom of the unit at floor level. For its size, this compact ceramic heater does a good job of keeping my feet warm and taking the chill out of any room where it is employed. A bigger than expected fan motor, quiet operation and good performance makes this a 'top pick' portable heater for the price."", ""Best heater on the market, so far. Heat where ever you put it very efficiently to the point, at times, I findmyself turning it down. Have one in my room, and the bathroom, which I let my brother hold for his room, so gonna get another for the bathroom, and one for the kitchen, because we're rarely in the living room. We're able to turn the gas hear off for the entire winter, and use it only to cook and wash clothes, with agas bill of less than $40 a month. The electric is a little higher than normal due to the heater, but nowherenear what utilities would normally cost with the gas included. So yes, this heater does actually save you a lot of money in other areas. And it's extremely sturdy, with a tip over mechanism that works even if the heater is slightly tilted.  Highly recommend. "", ""This has been the very best room heater i have ever purchased it keeps the whole room very warm i can even feel it from 5 feet away constructed like a regular furnace but much smaller don't let the size fool you this little heater will put out the heat baby and i will be buying more of them if they are still in stock i would recommend the Lasko 5812 anytime. thanks guys for a great deal that was well worth every penny."", 'It is the most powerful heater I have owned.

Since it is sturdy for standing on with work shoes it also is tough enough for cats and dogs to sleep on.

The wide range of heat settings and heavy construction make this a good purchase.', ""It's perfect!!!We live in Wisconsin with cold winter day's and night's. Hot water heat in our home so under the table gets real chilly because of having tile flooring.This unit is great because its warm enough to feel, yet not so warm you need to keep turning it on and off.I was also happy to see it had a lighted on/off switch about in the middle of the cord.If your legs ever get cool or cold under a desk or table, buy this unit!!!I wish I had it years ago and saved on the electric bill for the small heater I was using."", 'I repair watches my semi finished basement and I  have struggled trying to keep my feet and legs warm as my bench is against an outside wall. Have had an unheated rubber pad on the floor and it helped somewhat but this electric pad is great, l can actually sit in comfort even without shoes or extra pairs of socks.  Actually warms the air space for my legs too! Only used it for a few weeks but I am very impressed. Hope it lasts a long time.', ""It's a little hot for my feet in socks so I just folded up a bath floor towel into 1/4's and it's perfect in my basement office during the winter. I also use it with a Woods 50030 Indoor Countdown Timer so I never have to worry about leaving it on. Great product."", 'Take your shoes off and enjoy this foot pad on the coldest of days!!! Nice! And it has a handy on/off switch half way up the cord!!', ""I bought two of these foot warmers. One in March and one in May 2021.March purchased died in aprx September.May purchased survived till March 2022.Both were once placed under the table and never moved, so it's not a miss-use or broken cable. We always switched them off after several hours of use.Make your own judgment if it's acceptable. I don't think so.On the bright side - when it works it, well, works, keeping your feet warm.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr. Heater F242010 MH4GC Golf Cart HeaterSilver and Black,63.12,30-day returns,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

"Oscillating Radiant Dish Heater, 2 Settings, 3,412 BTUs -CZ998",64.33,30-day returns,"['Decent Performance but no where close to a Presto Heat Dish.. I bought this model in my rebellion against the high cost of a Presto replacement. It does have a couple of cool features we enjoy. Hi/Lo switch and it tilts forward or back for better heat aim', ""After the initial break-in time which is one or two days the heater is very enjoyable. Some lubricant used in manufacturing has to burn off during that time and it has a very strong odor. The best thing about this heater is that it is quiet! I appreciate the two different temperature settings, the low temperature setting being a little bit higher than other models similar to this - which is a good thing. My ceramic heaters which have a fan, work well but are just too noisy at night. The glow, when it is on high can take some getting used to when you're sleeping, but if you have it on low and it is closer to you, you feel the heat without the distraction of the light.  And finally, the heat is the type that heats YOU , and goes into your bones - like the feel of sunlight - pretty good. It Heats objects much more so than the air. "", 'Works well. Heats quickly and oscillates smoothly. Two heat setting. Wanted it to heat a small bathroon space - it does.', ""Unless you're in a closet, there is not enough wattage for this heater to do any good. I replaced an older model that was built much better (metal), and worked just as well with 700 watts verses the 1000 watts this model is supposed to use. Things aren't made well anymore in almost any category, this being just one of them."", ""When it oscillates, it makes some noise &amp; it's very annoying , so I just set it  on  the still mode. That's why I rated it as 3 stars because of the noise.   It keeps me warmer  better   when  I  set it  on the still mode  because  it concentrates the heat where it's directed. I  usually set it to the low setting  which is  700 watts  for energy savings ."", 'I am enjoying all the heat this puts out on low. Heats entire 325 sqft of the motorhome.

BATHROOM PRTBL HEATER WH,64.73,30-day returns,"[""I put this bathroom heater in my bedroom to compare with another good Lasko room heater of similar size and the same 1500 W but with different features. I like the angle of the heat blast from this bathroom heater better for when I'm sitting on my bed getting dressed in front of the heater, I am happier with the other in my office. which has a steeper angle of blast and a thermostat.I also use this bathroom heater in the bathroom for which it was intended. I wanted it above the sink level for safety, as there's nowhere else to put the heater but on the sink counter.  I  turned a fire safe small ceramic square kleenex holder upside down, and the heater's feet fit nicelyinside.This bathroom heater is convenient because of the one press button for a preset one hour of high heat for quick warmups such as in the bathroom or when getting dressed. No fussing with buttons. It also has High and Low settings that run without a timer.I also noticed that some sellers were saying their heaters were OK for the bathroom but the actual manufacturer did not.  This Bathroom heater is designed for the bathroom.  I'm not sure if the tripper in the cord is necessary if the outlet has one too, as many houses do these days in any water environment such as the bathroom or the kitchen.  I'm guessing the tripper in the plug reacts to the unit rather than the wall socket."", ""This heater does an excellent job of putting out a lot of air with the fan and also Heats the room excellently. For my application I'm using it in a fifth wheel trailer bathroom which is fairly small but one of the problems I'm having with the heater is I'm using a different thermostat on it that is more accurate to turn on and off and the heater shuts off and doesn't come back on when I use the thermostat on it so what you need to do is put something on the round button on top of the heater and tape it down to hold the button down all the time so that thermostat that I've got set up works properly and we'll kick the heater on when the temperature drops or more so when I want to heat the bathroom during a certain time of the day like when I take a shower.Otherwise the heater is an excellent heater and I would highly recommend anybody to buy it very good quality."", 'The heater is modern in design. It has a one hour feature that I love. I turn it on , shower get dressed in a warm bathroom, never have to wonder if I left it running. It automatically shuts off after 1 hour.', ""1. easy to turn on and off2. heats up fast3. has 1-hour auto shutoff4. very sturdy design, not likely to tip over5. made for humid areas like bathroomsbonus: it's cute!"", ""Here's the story:  To have my small bathroom warm when I get up in the morning for my shower, I had a small ceramic 1500 Watt heater connected into a wall timer to turn on automatically, and if I forgot (which I often did) to turn off automatically. With this Lasko heater, I tap the top when I'm ready to shower and it turns on high for one hour. Firstly, I don't have to remember to turn it off. Secondly, the velocity of the hot air coming out is so high that the bathroom heats up much quicker than my other heater, even though the wattage of both units is the same. This saves my electric bill.It seems to be good, quality wise, but it's only a month old now so we'll see.  November, 2020A note:  After it's turned off, and the top button (the big and only one) is tapped, it starts at the timed one hour 1500 Watt setting automatically."", ""It is difficult to find a space heater that is specifically for bathroom use. I was happy to find this one at this price and good reviews! It does exactly what I need it to do, I warm up my bathroom before a shower as my heat does not do that well - North side of house in Wisconsin! I will see how it holds up this winter, but so far very pleased with it's performance."", 'Works great! Instant heat . Small size is great. Comes with wet location plug  &amp; cord', ""Perfect replacement for my old heater that finally died. Small, lightweight, gets super warm in my little bathroom. Like that it's specifically made to use in a bathroom. Warming, the front grill can get hot!"", 'This little heater has all the power i need to heat up the bathroom in a hurry. Set it for an hour walk away and it turns itself off. Very nice 👍 made for humid bathroom areas. Very attractive too.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Electric Foot Warmer Mat 14  X 21  Keep Feet Warm Office Space Heater,62.73, ,"[""In a Northern state, I've got an expensive office and the brilliant engineers designed a heating system with freezing cold floors. Not only that, constantly getting in and out of the car means inevitable snow on one's shoes in bad weather. This is a prescription for cold feet.This product is ideal for the job. Made of rubber so it's impervious to water or stains, cranks out the heat on high and trolls along beautiful on low. Plus, it's good size, bigger than the cheapie models so you don't have to think about where your feet are placed. Great value and highly recommended."", ""This rubber mat is excellent. I use it under my desk to keep my feet warm. It gets very hot. I believe around 135 degrees is what the mat heats up to. So this isn't some cheap mat that kinda gets warm.You can use it to warm your boots up also. The mat is injection molded one piece so it is water proof also. Would probably work great at the front door to melt snow or ice also."", ""Bought because our 70 yr. old house hardwood floors aren't insulated. This product is durable heats evenly perfect on cold nights to keep my feet warm in front of the tv. Did put down a piece of cardboard beneath the mat and floor as suggested by a previous purchaser's comment do not know if necessary. Have been using for weeks works great waterproof is a bonus, easy to keep clean.      arkansas"", 'The foot warmer arrived in a large, flat cardboard carton. Its switch (from high to low wattage and off) works well. This is the second one I have bought, both not for my feet but for my outdoor dogs/cats. Though it was not guaranteed for pets it works well in dog houses when the temperature is at 10 degrees F. Since it is sturdy for standing on with work shoes it also is tough enough for cats and dogs to sleep on. I put a special wrap on the AC wire to it to prevent animals from damaging the cord and usually use it at the low wattage setting. It is much more sturdy than the electric pet pads that are being sold.', 'My significant other has an office area just outside of our main house, the floor is cold and so were her feet until we put one of these mats under her desk and another by her photo tent.  Now her feet are warm and she is happy, so am I.  The wide range of heat settings and heavy construction make this a good purchase.', ""It's perfect!!!We live in Wisconsin with cold winter day's and night's. Hot water heat in our home so under the table gets real chilly because of having tile flooring.This unit is great because its warm enough to feel, yet not so warm you need to keep turning it on and off.I was also happy to see it had a lighted on/off switch about in the middle of the cord.If your legs ever get cool or cold under a desk or table, buy this unit!!!I wish I had it years ago and saved on the electric bill for the small heater I was using."", 'I repair watches my semi finished basement and I  have struggled trying to keep my feet and legs warm as my bench is against an outside wall. Have had an unheated rubber pad on the floor and it helped somewhat but this electric pad is great, l can actually sit in comfort even without shoes or extra pairs of socks.  Actually warms the air space for my legs too! Only used it for a few weeks but I am very impressed. Hope it lasts a long time.', ""It's a little hot for my feet in socks so I just folded up a bath floor towel into 1/4's and it's perfect in my basement office during the winter. I also use it with a Woods 50030 Indoor Countdown Timer so I never have to worry about leaving it on. Great product."", 'Take your shoes off and enjoy this foot pad on the coldest of days!!! Nice! And it has a handy on/off switch half way up the cord!!', ""I bought two of these foot warmers. One in March and one in May 2021.March purchased died in aprx September.May purchased survived till March 2022.Both were once placed under the table and never moved, so it's not a miss-use or broken cable. We always switched them off after several hours of use.Make your own judgment if it's acceptable.

"Mr. Heater MH9BX 9000 BTU Propane Portable Buddy Heater, MH9BX (RED)",65.0, ,"[""This is a fantastic small space heater.  It heats up quickly and puts off a generous amount of heat for it's size.  It can heat a small room, or keep you warm when working outdoors in cool weather.  I hate having cold hands and this heater keeps me from not being able to do my mechanic work in the cold. With the built in safety features, I feel confident there won't be any problems.  I have several of the 1 lb propane bottles so I don't urn short.  Also if you get one of these heaters, pick up the propane bottle refill adapter sold on Amazon or elsewhere so you can fill the 1 lb bottles from your 20 lb tanks.  It's easy and way more economical. I have Electric heaters, but for outdoors, or when the power goes out, there's nothing like a Mr. Heater to help keep you warm.  It's small enough to take with you, but puts out more heat than the Electrics can.  Just use common sense where and how you use it, and all will be fine.   "", ""We have another Mr. Heater that works fine. However, the one I'm writing about here (just received) has a weak piezo spark emitter.

After checking out just about all of the available products on the market, I spotted the Lasko 5812 heater on Ebay- the ONLY one I could find that directs warm air into the room from the bottom of the unit at floor level. For its size, this compact ceramic heater does a good job of keeping my feet warm and taking the chill out of any room where it is employed. A bigger than expected fan motor, quiet operation and good performance makes this a 'top pick' portable heater for the price."", ""Best heater on the market, so far. Heat where ever you put it very efficiently to the point, at times, I findmyself turning it down. Have one in my room, and the bathroom, which I let my brother hold for his room, so gonna get another for the bathroom, and one for the kitchen, because we're rarely in the living room. We're able to turn the gas hear off for the entire winter, and use it only to cook and wash clothes, with agas bill of less than $40 a month. The electric is a little higher than normal due to the heater, but nowherenear what utilities would normally cost with the gas included. So yes, this heater does actually save you a lot of money in other areas. And it's extremely sturdy, with a tip over mechanism that works even if the heater is slightly tilted.  Highly recommend. "", ""This has been the very best room heater i have ever purchased it keeps the whole room very warm i can even feel it from 5 feet away constructed like a regular furnace but much smaller don't let the size fool you this little heater will put out the heat baby and i will be buying more of them if they are still in stock i would recommend the Lasko 5812 anytime. thanks guys for a great deal that was well worth every penny."", 'It is the most powerful heater I have owned. The first Lasko 5812 lasted 8 and one half years. It gives more heat on high as the duraflame cabinet heater I purchased for $100.00 this past fall. I should have bought another one of these to heat my larger room.', ""This is a great little heater. It takes the chill out of a room.

It’ll keep me nice and toasty this winter since my steam radiator barely works in my apartment!  ', ""I bought this heater to use to warm a living room with vaulted ceilings. It has a cool LED flame effect that can be used alone or in conjunction with heat.  I find that the lowest setting is more than adequate for keeping the living room warm.

Lasko CD08200 Bathroom Heater White,63.86,30-day returns,"[""I put this bathroom heater in my bedroom to compare with another good Lasko room heater of similar size and the same 1500 W but with different features. I like the angle of the heat blast from this bathroom heater better for when I'm sitting on my bed getting dressed in front of the heater, I am happier with the other in my office. which has a steeper angle of blast and a thermostat.I also use this bathroom heater in the bathroom for which it was intended. I wanted it above the sink level for safety, as there's nowhere else to put the heater but on the sink counter.  I  turned a fire safe small ceramic square kleenex holder upside down, and the heater's feet fit nicelyinside.This bathroom heater is convenient because of the one press button for a preset one hour of high heat for quick warmups such as in the bathroom or when getting dressed. No fussing with buttons. It also has High and Low settings that run without a timer.I also noticed that some sellers were saying their heaters were OK for the bathroom but the actual manufacturer did not.  This Bathroom heater is designed for the bathroom.  I'm not sure if the tripper in the cord is necessary if the outlet has one too, as many houses do these days in any water environment such as the bathroom or the kitchen.  I'm guessing the tripper in the plug reacts to the unit rather than the wall socket."", ""This heater does an excellent job of putting out a lot of air with the fan and also Heats the room excellently. For my application I'm using it in a fifth wheel trailer bathroom which is fairly small but one of the problems I'm having with the heater is I'm using a different thermostat on it that is more accurate to turn on and off and the heater shuts off and doesn't come back on when I use the thermostat on it so what you need to do is put something on the round button on top of the heater and tape it down to hold the button down all the time so that thermostat that I've got set up works properly and we'll kick the heater on when the temperature drops or more so when I want to heat the bathroom during a certain time of the day like when I take a shower.Otherwise the heater is an excellent heater and I would highly recommend anybody to buy it very good quality."", 'The heater is modern in design. It has a one hour feature that I love. I turn it on , shower get dressed in a warm bathroom, never have to wonder if I left it running. It automatically shuts off after 1 hour.', ""1. easy to turn on and off2. heats up fast3. has 1-hour auto shutoff4. very sturdy design, not likely to tip over5. made for humid areas like bathroomsbonus: it's cute!"", ""Here's the story:  To have my small bathroom warm when I get up in the morning for my shower, I had a small ceramic 1500 Watt heater connected into a wall timer to turn on automatically, and if I forgot (which I often did) to turn off automatically. With this Lasko heater, I tap the top when I'm ready to shower and it turns on high for one hour. Firstly, I don't have to remember to turn it off. Secondly, the velocity of the hot air coming out is so high that the bathroom heats up much quicker than my other heater, even though the wattage of both units is the same. This saves my electric bill.It seems to be good, quality wise, but it's only a month old now so we'll see.  November, 2020A note:  After it's turned off, and the top button (the big and only one) is tapped, it starts at the timed one hour 1500 Watt setting automatically."", ""It is difficult to find a space heater that is specifically for bathroom use. I was happy to find this one at this price and good reviews! It does exactly what I need it to do, I warm up my bathroom before a shower as my heat does not do that well - North side of house in Wisconsin! I will see how it holds up this winter, but so far very pleased with it's performance."", 'Works great! Instant heat . Small size is great. Comes with wet location plug  &amp; cord', ""Perfect replacement for my old heater that finally died. Small, lightweight, gets super warm in my little bathroom. Like that it's specifically made to use in a bathroom. Warming, the front grill can get hot!"", 'This little heater has all the power i need to heat up the bathroom in a hurry.

"F271803 Hose, Tank to Quick Disconnect, 12-Ft. - Quantity 1",63.76, ,"[""I've had a Buddy heater for a couple years now, but hadn't worried about hooking up the BBQ grille tanks since I had a stockpile of the little camping propane cylinders from years of prepping. But this winter I realized we could be in for a few days without power like back in 1993, so I didn't feel secure about having enough gas to last. There are only two negatives I have with this hose, but it's still a five star product. The problems are:1) I wish it was longer. Placing the cylinder outside and running the hose through a window limits placement of the heater drastically with only tells feet of length.2) It takes quite a while to get the hose filled with propane to the point where the heater will light. That's to be expected, but that also means a fair amount of gas is lost when disconnecting.Neither of these two problems are really problems per se, just inconveniences.The heater is a really awesome unit. The hose just makes it exponentially better. Buy it."", ""I hooked it up to my LP bottle. You need to push the quick disconnect up until the slide moves up to lock it. It's a little tight but it is a good connection when complete. Bled the air out of the hose with a screwdriver in the quick disconnect. Then hooked it to the heater. It lit up quite quickly. Ran it through all the settings from Pilot, low, medium, to high. Worked very well. Has a nice pliable rubber hose, even in 30° temperature. A little pricey. Otherwise good. "", 'This was delivered a month ago and we have used it daily, until today..The regulator blew a diaphragm inside I guess and was shooting ice cold propane all over the place.  We were not even using it when this happened, luckily or we would have been blown up. Great hose, crappy regulator.  New one is 2 stage and set me back about $30. ', 'The new tank connection, righty tighty, lefty loosey,  is much easier to use.  Nice, well made hose and regulator combo.
