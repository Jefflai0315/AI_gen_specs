Comfort Zone Tower Heater 1500-Watt Electric Quartz Infrared Radiant,67.8,Last item available,"[""This a very cost effective space heater to warm any area during a chilly winter, or - as we had during the early part of the Wisconsin spring - a slightly nippy start to spring. It works to warm a bedroom, normal sized living room (unsure of those with an open plan large setting), or a small area of a basement that you are working in. It has three settings, and has tip-over &amp; overheat protection. I like this product an awful lot, and thus I'll give it 4.5 stars. It does NOT have a remote, but I bought a separate one for that purpose. I am taking a half of a star off because EVEN though it does have tip over protection (meaning it shuts off in that case), it is slightly more easy to tip over than I thought it was. So if you have pets, it might NOT be the BEST idea to use it when they are out playing - NOT so much for safety sake, but to prevent your fur baby from getting injured stepping on it."", 'Works very well and set up takes only a few minutes...', ""This will be my last one.

Presto Heat Dish Plus Parabolic Electric Heater,69.96, ,"[""I use this heater in my clinic and my patients absolutely love it. It's amazing how quickly it heats a room without air blasting or noise. It has a nice safety feature where it makes a horrible noise if it's tipping over (it only happens if I'm moving it when it's on). In fact several of my patients have gone out and bought their own for home. I should get a commission."", 'I have an old 1911 craftsman style house with no insulation.  My heating system is an outdated oil furnace.  As we all know the price of fuel is always fluctuating and seems like it is going to stay that way.  It costs me about $300.00 a month in the winter.  Which is ridiculous, especially when the heat just does not stay in the house for long.I needed a knew plan and changing out the heat system or insulating the house is not an option at this time.  So I went out and bought the presto heatdish.  It produces so much heat that during the winter I no longer had to heat the entire house to stay warm.  I would just carry the heatdish around with me, saving me hundreds of dollars month to month.  I had a few other electric heaters before I purchased this one and the difference is night and day.I  have had this heater for almost 3 years now and it still works as well as the day I purchased it.  It paid for itself in its first week work.  With as much use as this gets I would of expected it to burn out a while ago, but that is not the case.The drawbacks: It does not have an automatic turn off system if it were to fall over, but it does have an alarm that is unmistakably loud.   There is also a footlight that you cannot turn off or on, but you can just take out the lightbulb if that bothers you.Great product and highly recommended. Thanks for reading.', ""Proven, ancient technology that outperforms the daylights of newer, highly rated products. It's effective (heats the room quickly and thoroughly), efficient (only 1,000 watts), safe (automatic shut-off features), and built to last. Sometimes a product cannot be improved upon.  "", 'It gives off a good amount of heat but it has one big design flaw where the dish can not be tilted. This means the dish is in a fixed position which points into the air slightly. So if the surface you place it on is taller than you are while seated you will struggle to feel it. The safety tip over buzzer also prevents you from sliding something underneath it to tilt it yourself.', ""This is a wonderful heater.  I am a smoker and visit my family a lot.  I choose to smoke in the garage there and my sister in law bought this for me to use in the garage. It warms up quickly for the immediate area and it doesn't take long for the surrounding areas to warm up either. Once this gets going I don't even need a coat.  (Ohio area)  I have a house with very tall ceilings in the master bedroom and living area.  In the winter this little heater warms up quickly, even going right to the high setting.  I always have to turn it way back too.  I am widowed now and I don't need to keep the entire house warm, just where I am.  I do recommend this.  Oh, it is safe, if you move it at all when it is on you get a loud buzz sound!  If on the fence about it I would go with it."", 'Great price, lightweight, energy efficient. It has worked very well so far. The price was the best I found on Ebay. I think the design is very good. The shape of the dish plus the shiny interior helps it be much more efficient than a regular space heater. It gets very hot very fast. It also has a buzzer in case it tips over. A great all around heater to warm a person up fast.', ""These are fabulous heaters (radiant warmth, like the sun) and are in great condition.At first they didn't quite meet my needs, because I needed them to point straight ahead, whereas they are angled slightly upward and this is not adjustable. However, I set each heater on a slanted platform (which I made out of heavy cardboard), and now they meet my needs perfectly. (Parabolic heat dish heaters warm whatever is directly in front of them, within about, say, 15 feet.) You won't believe how much glowing warmth they put out!Also, Rob was great to do business with."", ""I live in a 1920's craftsman style house with poor insulation. This heater is wonderful and has allowed me to turn my thermostat down several degrees and still be comfortable here in Minnesota. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could because it is actually a little bit large to walk around in a small house with small rooms.  But that said, even set as low as it will go, it still puts out a lot of heat. In fact, I have to be careful not to put it in a room near my thermostat because the furnace will not come on at all if I do!  I have already recommended it to friends."", 'This heat dish pumps out heat so intensely it’s like a dryer for your cloths if sitting in front of it. I could feel it’s radiant heat from about 15ft away. Wayyyy better than other heat dish I had no contest. It does not oscillate and no remote only 2 features not on this probably because it is heavy duty. This is the best heat dish, look no further. ', ""I had a socially distanced bourbon tasting party for four on my back patio during January 2021 in Chicago. My neighbor had two of the Presto dishes so I ordered two more. Even though the evening's temperature dipped into the mid-20s, all four of us were completely comfortable sitting in our patio chairs with a our own Presto dish to keep us warm.

I bought it to use in a 4\'x6\'x3\' coop and it raised the inside temperature by approximately 10 degrees... not very helpful when the outside temperature averages 10 degrees or less all winter. I tried it in the house first and the temperature sticker (heat sensor) glowed after a few minutes. Once I put it outside, the sticker hasn\'t glowed at all and the chicken\'s water has frozen twice - despite being within inches of the heater.

Monitor it when you first use it, a weak or bad electrical receptacle can arc! Your plug or power cord could melt or burn. The risk always exists when you use it. I use to do electrician work long ago, be mindful.Read all instructions thoroughly and completely! DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED! I still like to use this heater, in fact I own two of them.

"Mr. Heater, Big Buddy, 12', Hose Tank To Quick Disconnect F271803",66.99,7 watchers,"[""I've had a Buddy heater for a couple years now, but hadn't worried about hooking up the BBQ grille tanks since I had a stockpile of the little camping propane cylinders from years of prepping. But this winter I realized we could be in for a few days without power like back in 1993, so I didn't feel secure about having enough gas to last. There are only two negatives I have with this hose, but it's still a five star product. The problems are:1) I wish it was longer. Placing the cylinder outside and running the hose through a window limits placement of the heater drastically with only tells feet of length.2) It takes quite a while to get the hose filled with propane to the point where the heater will light. That's to be expected, but that also means a fair amount of gas is lost when disconnecting.Neither of these two problems are really problems per se, just inconveniences.The heater is a really awesome unit. The hose just makes it exponentially better. Buy it."", ""I hooked it up to my LP bottle. You need to push the quick disconnect up until the slide moves up to lock it. It's a little tight but it is a good connection when complete. Bled the air out of the hose with a screwdriver in the quick disconnect. Then hooked it to the heater. It lit up quite quickly. Ran it through all the settings from Pilot, low, medium, to high. Worked very well. Has a nice pliable rubber hose, even in 30° temperature. A little pricey. Otherwise good. "", 'This was delivered a month ago and we have used it daily, until today..The regulator blew a diaphragm inside I guess and was shooting ice cold propane all over the place.  We were not even using it when this happened, luckily or we would have been blown up. Great hose, crappy regulator.  New one is 2 stage and set me back about $30. ', 'The new tank connection, righty tighty, lefty loosey,  is much easier to use.  Nice, well made hose and regulator combo. The quick disconnect end is also handy.', 'Males using Heater much easier', 'Exactly as described fit with no problem', 'Great product a must if u r going to use it alot', 'No Issues. Just a great product.

Even though the appearance of the current model is similar to the previous unit....it is an impressively improved design with new safety features...lights up very quickly and has an improved selector knob for the 3 different heat settings...', 'As far as the propane heater there are many choices but I be owned this same model unit not including new one I just purchased over 6 years and it HSS given me no problems for my outside heating needs. Now I live in az but we get some cold nights here and even have used indoors in larger part of house its not recommended since carbon monoxide poising can be a real threat. I reccomend thus product if your looking for good value and a trusted name.', 'This is the second one I have ordered. These work great and are easy to use. I highly recommend these to anyone who needs instant heat.', ""This is a great product! Well made with quality in mind. I especially like the tipover shutoff feature as it relates to safety. This my second unit and they're durible and made to last. I highly recommend.Mike in Tucson"", 'Mr. Heater is the only way to go if you need a propane tank heater.  I bought two Harbor Freight heaters and had to return both of them because they either wouldn’t light or stay lit.  Mr. Heater installed easily, came with very simple instructions and started the first time.  Plus it’s very quiet!  I would highly recommend Mr. Heater and eBay easily had the best price.', ""Bought this basically as heat for the garage in case the power goes out, so my water lines don't freeze. I have used the heater a dozen times just testing it, while I messed around in the garage. Works exactly as the description said it would. No problems or issues as of now. Easy to install on the tank. Easy to light."", ""we use ours on a daily basis, and they typically fail within one year to 15 months. one of the safeties will malfunction, and the unit will either not produce any gas or will not stay lit. had to put a hose clamp around the startup plunger just to have heat, that brought it's useful life to almost 2 years. my mechanic has one that is maybe 10 years old that still works...it has no safeties. might as well buy the cheaper chinese ones and save money."", 'THIS IS A SAFETY IMPROVED UPGRADE OF THE ORIGINAL MR. HEATER AND IT ADDS A MOTION/TIP OVER SHUTOFF FEATURE .  SIZE IS COMPACT BUT THIS WORKS BEST WITH A 20 POUND TANK.  OUTPUT IS ROBUST AND OF A RADIANT NATURE THAT WORKS WELL FOR OUR DECK OFF-SEASON.   COMBUSTION IS NEAR COMPLETE FOR RARELY A WHIFF OF GAS.  ', 'This little heater works great, all week long using it in the evenings on low and only used 2.5 gal of propane. The only gripe would be the wire support bar thing is not the best design and the screw that holds it to the base of the heater is too short. For the price it is a good investment.', 'A small cook stove with a blue flame is good. This product is better. It has a lot of surface area and the flame can then burn hotter.

I called the company and they were great with me. I really felt good about the company. I sent them both back as a set and with no hassle they sent me another set. I had the choice of the money or another sent. I picked another sett because they work exolent, no issues and like I said it heats my 29ft Travel Trailer.

Nice thermostat that’s pretty accurate, nice quick heat up, blower fairly strong. They are not near as good as a 220Volt or gas heater. But for the price you get 2.

Ceramic Heater Fan Battery Hook Plug In Portable Car Truck 300 Watt Electric 12V,67.83,23 sold,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product?

Lasko Portable Space Heater 500-Watt Electric Convection Tip-Over Safety Switch,68.41,Last item available,"[""With the cold grip of a long winter making the house too chilly to stay comfortable, I looked for some space heaters to help out the central A/C system. After checking out just about all of the available products on the market, I spotted the Lasko 5812 heater on Ebay- the ONLY one I could find that directs warm air into the room from the bottom of the unit at floor level. For its size, this compact ceramic heater does a good job of keeping my feet warm and taking the chill out of any room where it is employed. A bigger than expected fan motor, quiet operation and good performance makes this a 'top pick' portable heater for the price."", ""Best heater on the market, so far. Heat where ever you put it very efficiently to the point, at times, I findmyself turning it down. Have one in my room, and the bathroom, which I let my brother hold for his room, so gonna get another for the bathroom, and one for the kitchen, because we're rarely in the living room. We're able to turn the gas hear off for the entire winter, and use it only to cook and wash clothes, with agas bill of less than $40 a month. The electric is a little higher than normal due to the heater, but nowherenear what utilities would normally cost with the gas included. So yes, this heater does actually save you a lot of money in other areas. And it's extremely sturdy, with a tip over mechanism that works even if the heater is slightly tilted.  Highly recommend. "", ""This has been the very best room heater i have ever purchased it keeps the whole room very warm i can even feel it from 5 feet away constructed like a regular furnace but much smaller don't let the size fool you this little heater will put out the heat baby and i will be buying more of them if they are still in stock i would recommend the Lasko 5812 anytime. thanks guys for a great deal that was well worth every penny."", 'It is the most powerful heater I have owned. The first Lasko 5812 lasted 8 and one half years. It gives more heat on high as the duraflame cabinet heater I purchased for $100.00 this past fall. I should have bought another one of these to heat my larger room.', ""This is a great little heater. It takes the chill out of a room.

Electric Heater 1500-Watt Quartz Radiant Heating Adjustable Thermostat Black,65.59,30-day returns,"[""This a very cost effective space heater to warm any area during a chilly winter, or - as we had during the early part of the Wisconsin spring - a slightly nippy start to spring. It works to warm a bedroom, normal sized living room (unsure of those with an open plan large setting), or a small area of a basement that you are working in. It has three settings, and has tip-over &amp; overheat protection. I like this product an awful lot, and thus I'll give it 4.5 stars. It does NOT have a remote, but I bought a separate one for that purpose. I am taking a half of a star off because EVEN though it does have tip over protection (meaning it shuts off in that case), it is slightly more easy to tip over than I thought it was. So if you have pets, it might NOT be the BEST idea to use it when they are out playing - NOT so much for safety sake, but to prevent your fur baby from getting injured stepping on it."", 'Works very well and set up takes only a few minutes...', ""This will be my last one.

Lasko 755320 Ceramic Space Tower Heater,69.0, ,"[""Had one of these for several years to heat an office work space in my home. Did a great job.  Wanted another small heater for another room on another floor so i didn't have to carry the one I had up /down stairs. Decided to get another Lasko  similar to what i had, rather than risk another brand/model. This Lasko is  reliable, heats quickly, has auto off and an oscillation feature. All pluses and it's light weight.  Can't say it's energy efficient. No small electric heaters are. Heater arrived quickly.  Several days before the targeted delivery date. "", ""With the high cost of propane,  I was looking for a way to help cut some cost. I bought two heaters. The other one is already in storage, (does not work nearly as good as this unit). So far our coldest day has only been down in the mid 30's. With this heater, until it dropped that cold, our Propane hed never needed to kick on once. This is a GREAT Little Heater for Full Time RV'ers, or anyone whom wants to cut down there gas/propane heating bill. Were due to start getting colder weather, So I am now looking for a second heater to help the one we have to heat our 33 foot 5th wheel RV. "", 'This heater is quiet, has hi and lo settings.  Unlike some heaters, As far as I can tell, it does not have an automatic shut off when it tips over, which is a nice safety feature. I have had another Lasko heater for several years, and it has been dependable.', 'I now own 3 of these heater and love them. I live in a rural area with propane being my main source of heat, but I installed solar making electric heat cost effective. I run these in rooms we occupy instead of using propane to heat in needed areas. The on-off range of these heaters is about 3-4 degrees. The run very quiet to the point they are quieter than our tower fan that we use in the summer. Great product and now to see how long it will last.', ""This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I purchased the second because I was so impressed with the features and functioning of the first.  It has a remote (I haven't even used), on-off timer up to 8 hours, one direction or variable direction heating and most important, an accurate thermostat control.  I first started using the original purchase to keep my garage above freezing during low temperature cold spells.  That showed me what a great functional heater this was for any area of the house where additional heat is required."", ""I'll know in a month if this unit is truly energy efficient as I've been using it more than my furnace in the evenings.The only complaint I have is the thermostat may not be accurate. I'll set it for auto shut off when it reaches 70 degrees  but it never seems to get past 67 degrees so it keeps running. When I check the temp on my furnace's thermostat it reads 71 degrees so I know it's heating- just not reaching the correct temp internally to auto shut off.It's relatively quiet and heats a large room up in about 30 mins. or less provided all the windows and doors are closed to hold the heat in. My cats still freak out and won't go near it, especially when it oscillates. Funny stuff!"", ""This little heater is great as a heat supplement for a decent size room (and have actually used it to heat multiple rooms at the same time). Sturdy, safe, and the remote is quite convenient! The internal thermostat can be a little wonky depending if you're opening or closing a bunch of doors, or if people are walking by it constantly, but it straightens itself out fairly quickly. Happy enough with this product that I bought another one for my office!"", ""It's a great heater no question very good quality but I was under the impression it was a fan/heater but there is no just fan feature on it and I know they are made but not this one 😩 as the description of it let me to believe"", ""I love this heater since you can set the temperature you want, light weight for moving and has a remote control for setting the desired temperature. It's just a great heater for bathroom or bedroom and I love it."", ""It's a LASKO first off, and second it's CERAMIC material which is The best to provide The correct amount of heat when set without overheating The Unit at The same time! Third, It comes with A REMOTE CONTROL!. Forth, The Unit OSCILLATES Back, and Forth to heat entire Area, and has The Usual Digital Display on Top of The Heating Unit. The Oscillation can be Set by The Remote as well. PROS: Great Designed Unit. CONS: NONE That I have Found Yet!""]","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.

5307 Oscillating Ceramic Tower Heater - Quantity 1,65.54, ,"['I live in Oakland, California in the USA. The usual temperature here during winter nights goes between 35 to 40 something degrees Fahrenheit. I use it to warm up a small room (10 feet x 10 feet x 8 feet, without insulation). I usually turn it on with maximum temperature and speed for around 20 minutes. The room would be heat up to reasonably warm. Usually, I could turn the heater off for about half an hour before I need to turn it on again.', 'Great small room space heater.  Simple controls.  Quiet but not so quiet you forget and leave it on.  Only wish I knew heating watts on the low heat setting.  Have not put the thermostat into use yet...maybe try to use it/get the heater cycling at some warm bathroom temperature in the winter.', ""This unit is closely-related to the one (same brand &amp; features) I've been using these past 5+ years.  A reliable workhorse, with a bonus: It turns into a no-heat fan in the summer!!  Fits compactly under my desk."", 'This little heater has amazing power. It is small . I use it on a medium setting and it heats a very large area. No need to turn it all the way up. I’m very happy with this heater.', ""I've had many space heaters over the years, but this one is a gem: a high-quality product that works well and quickly. It's the quietest heater I've ever had. The oscillating heating tower guarantees the whole room gets warm. The tower design is sleek, and the whole unit takes up little space. This machine has heft and seems well made. Though it's about 3-times taller than it is wide, most of the weight is in the base, which makes it feel solid and not prone to tipping over easily. I'm so in love with this baby that I'm buying a second -- FOR MY 3-ROOM APARTMENT!! lolI wholeheartedly recommend this product."", ""Received this tower fan and it's very sturdy, has several settings: air, low heat and higher heat. Large enough to heat a medium sized room; only complaint is it smells a bit antiseptic."", 'I have not actually used my LASKO 5370 Ceramic/ Oscillating Heater yet. I purchased the LASKO Name. Have always had longevity with their products. I highly recommend.', ""Very appropriate for heating a small space - generates desired heat; good price and good design...would have been rated a '5 star' if it has an auto shut off when desired room temp is reached."", 'This product works well, is easy to move around to different locations, and keeps me cozy when I am chilled.  I would recommend it to others!  ', ""Almost bought the more expensive model because it came with a remote. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and found one in here!

Not only does it produce heat well but it is also is aesthetically pleasing in an office setting.  Those points combined with many levels of heat to chose from and a remote control feature to boot...perfection!!  Three purchases and each for less than $60...it's a winner!!"", ""The reason I wanted this heater was I needed supplemental heat to my daughters room which is the furthest from the central heating system and surrounded by three ouside walls. Have been using a small oscillating ceramic heater for a couple years, but not thermostat controlled. Love the Lasko, cause it heats room evenly and quickly! Love that it does shut down when it get's up to the right temp. I would reccomend this heater to anyone. You can not however use thermostat control on LO setting. Only on High. Also like the overall appearance of it. Nice product!"", 'It would be great if it would operate in Automatic via the Thermostat on Low. It will not though as it will default to Max and if you set a temperature it reverts back to High mode which blows my Breaker! A nice design with a great oscillation feature. If you can run it on High which draws 12-14 Amps then it will work well for you! Why they disable temperature controlled operation in Low mode is baffling to me! ', 'This heater is a pretty good source of additional warmth where you need it. You may get tired of people asking you what it is though... It will not heat an entire home, but in my 22x28 living room, it does a pretty good job warming things up. Quiet and pretty. The remote works great, (even though it is almost as weird of a shape as the heater).', ""The heater is very dependable , I've had one for 1 year now. I have purchased two additional for other rooms. These units do the job of heating rooms well. They're very fashionable convenient."", 'first off gotta say this heater warms a medium size room very fast..and very wellalso easy to operate. only problem is the heater is very noise. looked over the reviewspeople said very quit very little sound NOT true loud fan and when oscillating is onmakes a verroom verroom sound [ best way to describe it]  gonna need to get out theear plugs gave it four stars for its heating', ""This little heater is great for taking the chill out of the air. My cottage is under 1000 ft, and the kitchen and living room are open to each other and I typically keep the temp at 66-68 24x7. Because of that vast space I originally had my doubts but now that I have used it for a week, it does a great job. It definately raises the temp a few degress which makes a big difference for me. (Don't rely on this heater being your main source of heat but rather as a supplement)."", ""expertbenefitsI haven't had it too long but it fits my purpose. I have central hearing but being an older place that I just got and having colder weather than usual, it just wasn't enough.  I have used it mostly for showers inn one bathroom and have an e-heater in the other one so I am all set. I like that this is portable so that I can move it around. It has a good range of settings, changes quickly. I actually read about it in Consumer Reports and looked on eBay so I got it.  The stand keeps it stable. It kind of cute too!"", 'I like the design of the heater very much and it certainly has enough output to heat what I intended it for.  I also like the features that it offers.  The only thing that I wish it did and it does not do is turn back on when the thermostat goes below what it is set at as well as turn off when it reaches the temperature.  All in all though, it is a good value and I have been pleased with it.', ""Granted it's not more than 1000 square feet, but this pretty little heater sits in the center of my house and keeps the whole house comfortable.  It has a thermostat,  (only 5 degree increments) but still will save me money by shutting off when the room is warm enough.  It has a convenient remote control.

Heated Foot Warmer Black Cozy Toasty Toes 105 Watt 120 Volt New and Improved,70.0,30-day returns,"[""First, a Toasty Toes draws 105 watts (not 90) and is warranted for ONLY 6 MONTHS (not 1 year).OK, so the minimal warranty, particularly on this basic an item, suggests that you're probably not getting a first class product, and its shoddy factory packaging which makes you look twice to make sure you haven't gotten open-box merchandise - The tape doesn't even stick to the cardboard! - confirms it.I called the company and was told that my Toasty Toes should get to 120º on its low heat setting and 140º on high.Nope!!! I've had two of them: the first one didn't get much past 100º...went back, and the second one got to 120º, but no higher...also went back. (The high heat option may work only when the unit is vertical, but I obviously haven't been able to find out.)As far as I can tell, they're using an unique design/cute name combo as an excuse to charge WAAAY TOO MUCH MONEY for an INFERIOR PRODUCT! :(My observations about my Toasty Toes insofar as it worked: I was hoping it would compensate for a cold floor draft, but I found that in its horizontal position it warmed the bottoms of my feet while leaving the tops cold, which left them pretty uncomfortable...not at all what I had hoped for.And in its vertical position it was inadequate on its low heat setting, and I'm not about to buy a third one (Softball rules: two strikes, and you're out!) in the hope that it may actually work both as it's supposed to and as I'd like.Looks like it's back to my ancient, reliable 600 watt radiant jobby, and damn the electricity bills, full comfort ahead! :)"", 'I read previous reviews of the earlier model of this item saying it did not get warm enough to feel through your shoes. (It worked OK with socks or bare feet).  That is why I bought the newer model having 104 Watts. (The box design is different than the older model.)  It does keep your feet warm even with shoes on.  (It takes a few minutes to warm up.)  It is sturdy, has two heat settings, and can be used in three positions.  (The two different pairs of legs fold out from the bottom.)  It does everything it is supposed to do.  I can not want more than that.  It has a six month warranty.', 'Actually keeps your feet warm.  I do a lot of computer work and my feet get sooooooo cold.  When your feet are warm, the rest of you stays warm.  Best with slippers.   tested with killawat tester.  97 watts at medium, 195 watts at high.  to stay warm for less than a hundred watts is a miracle.   I use as medium and have to take feet off periodically to cool down.  This is so wonderful. Thanks Cozy Products.', ""The product is sturdy and works well.  It includes two legs that let it incline at a sharper angle.  The legs don't latch very well but if don't need that feature, it is very good."", 'It does the job keeping my feet warm.Would be improved if it had an automatic off after x hours and/or more than one temperature setting.', 'This is exactly what I needed for my office in the winter.Even on low I sometime need to take my shoes off the footrest to let them cool off!I have been using it two weeks and so far even forgetting to turn it off over night has not hurt it at all.', ""It's made well but wow, does this get hot!  Even on low it gets uncomfortably hot - I haven't even tried the High setting.  I would not recommend this product."", 'Works as advertised.

Mr. Heater Fuel Filter  Buddy Heaters F273699,65.00, ,"['This is the correct filter for using a hose with your Mr Heater. It filters oils that can come from the hose and any trash that might have found its way into hose. Arrived as advertised and ready to go.', ""Those little 1 lb. cylinders are great but if you want to heat for longer than a couple hours you'll find buying a 20 lb. propane tank, a long supply hose and a regulator a must.  My old Mr. Buddys used to work without a regulator but the new one I got wouldn't even light the pilot light without the regulator.  At any rate, I'm sitting warm and Mr. Buddy is working.  Do yourself a favor - even if you don't regularly use a big tank with Mr Buddy having the regulator and hose will give you peace of mind knowing should you need heat for a longer time you've got everything you need to stay warm.  It turns your propane heater from something you can use occasionally to knock the chill off into a heater you can depend on in an emergency."", 'Fuel filter kit matched up with my Mr. Heater without any issues. Works great.', ""I wish it weren't necessary to purchase these filters, because they are expensive and don't last particularly long.  However, they are absolutely necessary.  I learned the hard way with my first Mr. Buddy, which I ran with standard unfiltered propane canisters, which the Mr. Buddy is designed for.  In a season, the heater was hopelessly clogged and useless.  These filters will prevent that from happening.  The problem, unfortunately, is that, with the filters installed, standard canisters don't fit into the heater compartments that are designed to hold them.  The central promise of the Mr. Buddy—portability—is thus dead on arrival."", 'An excellent add-on to a Mr. Heater. Will keep the tiny orifice open and clear, if you are using a 20lbs propane tank. ', ""Have had a Big Buddy for several years as my space heater in the winter. Have always had this filter installed for protection. The filters aren't cheap, but you must have them as a blockage and the cleaning process thereafter is a pain. That's the only reason they are a good value."", 'This product came very fast and it really improve my tent heat performance. Before, I had trouble with the heater. Was hard to start and very hard to keep pilot fire lit. After installing it the pilot heats up fast and stays lit. Nice product, I bought two of them. Both heaters run excellent.', ""The hose I ordered does not require the fuel filter.  My error.  I'm only keeping it in case I buy one that does to run 2 tanks.  Not really a decorater item, so that idea is out.  Into the spares locker on the boat. "", 'Works as needed for Mr heater Buddy heaters.I mistakenly used a generic extension hose from 20lb propane bottle to Buddy heater a few times before the heater stopped working from ""goo"" which came from hose.This filter is much needed for Buddy heaters,I even use it for portable BBQ\'s for same reason.I did learn if the hose from bottle is made by Mr Heater it is fine without filter,true or not I have not tried it yet,Mr Heater uses different materiel for their hoses', ""I used my heaters 2 or 3 times without filter, never again.

Lasko 5812 Automatic Air-flow Heater,68.72,30-day returns,"[""With the cold grip of a long winter making the house too chilly to stay comfortable, I looked for some space heaters to help out the central A/C system. After checking out just about all of the available products on the market, I spotted the Lasko 5812 heater on Ebay- the ONLY one I could find that directs warm air into the room from the bottom of the unit at floor level. For its size, this compact ceramic heater does a good job of keeping my feet warm and taking the chill out of any room where it is employed. A bigger than expected fan motor, quiet operation and good performance makes this a 'top pick' portable heater for the price."", ""Best heater on the market, so far. Heat where ever you put it very efficiently to the point, at times, I findmyself turning it down. Have one in my room, and the bathroom, which I let my brother hold for his room, so gonna get another for the bathroom, and one for the kitchen, because we're rarely in the living room. We're able to turn the gas hear off for the entire winter, and use it only to cook and wash clothes, with agas bill of less than $40 a month. The electric is a little higher than normal due to the heater, but nowherenear what utilities would normally cost with the gas included. So yes, this heater does actually save you a lot of money in other areas. And it's extremely sturdy, with a tip over mechanism that works even if the heater is slightly tilted.  Highly recommend. "", ""This has been the very best room heater i have ever purchased it keeps the whole room very warm i can even feel it from 5 feet away constructed like a regular furnace but much smaller don't let the size fool you this little heater will put out the heat baby and i will be buying more of them if they are still in stock i would recommend the Lasko 5812 anytime. thanks guys for a great deal that was well worth every penny."", 'It is the most powerful heater I have owned. The first Lasko 5812 lasted 8 and one half years. It gives more heat on high as the duraflame cabinet heater I purchased for $100.00 this past fall.

Comfort Zone WG-4X-C33098 120V Black Radiant Quartz Tower Heater 6 L in.,69.22,30-day returns,"[""This a very cost effective space heater to warm any area during a chilly winter, or - as we had during the early part of the Wisconsin spring - a slightly nippy start to spring. It works to warm a bedroom, normal sized living room (unsure of those with an open plan large setting), or a small area of a basement that you are working in. It has three settings, and has tip-over &amp; overheat protection. I like this product an awful lot, and thus I'll give it 4.5 stars. It does NOT have a remote, but I bought a separate one for that purpose. I am taking a half of a star off because EVEN though it does have tip over protection (meaning it shuts off in that case), it is slightly more easy to tip over than I thought it was. So if you have pets, it might NOT be the BEST idea to use it when they are out playing - NOT so much for safety sake, but to prevent your fur baby from getting injured stepping on it."", 'Works very well and set up takes only a few minutes...', ""This will be my last one.

Mr. Heater F242010 MH4GC Golf Cart HeaterSilver and Black,69.28,30-day returns,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.

DuraHeat Portable Electric Space Heater 1500-Watt Yellow with Pivoting Base,,30-day returns,"[""I am somewhat disappointed with this heater.  I work in a large open workspace and winter mornings can be uncomfortable with lower temperatures.  I purchased this heater with the impression that it force out a strong powerful heat.  It surely looks the part.  When I plugged it in, I realized that it didn't put out any more forced hot air than the cheap Walmart heaters. When it heats up, it does warm up an area in my house without problem, but rather useless where I work.  Its also not affective in my garage. My garage is not insulated. Again, the purpose of this heater was to have a reliable source of warm air to work in my garage.  It simply does not have the blower power that it looks to have. Its a good space heater for any room, but not  what I needed it for.  I am disappointed. These should be made with a more powerful blower."", ""Pros - quiet operation.Con - gives off about as much heat as a candle.Do not recommend this product for cold applications.If the room was in the 40's (F) or 50's (F) maybe this would work.  I used it in my garage with a starting temp of 34 (F) and the coils never even glowed.  Gave off some heat but could hold me hand directly in front of the unit for an extended period of time.  Also the picture on the box showed the inner coil glowing, which gives you a sense this unit puts out some heat.  That doesn't happen either.  Would maybe use this in a office setting but not in a work shop."", 'I bought this product  because I have a moderate problem with bed bugs and I know heat is supposed to be one of the methods of killing these bugs. I have not tried using it for this purpose yet but I have used it in my bathroom to see if it would help dry wet clothes which worked well and it also helped me to see how well it heated and see if maybe if it could be a possibility for killing the bugs I have a problem with. not sure if it strong enough for this idea but works great for helping dry clothes and heat a small bathroom. I would suggest anyone trying to use it for any of these purposes closely moniter this heater and not leaving it on when leaving their home or for extended lengths of time , but it is a nice little heater and I would recommend it.', ""Purchases this item because I just poker games in my garage and living in Chicago and being in the winter we needed a heater to help out during game time. I put the heater in max mode and not matter what it just wasn't throwing out enough heat.You literally have to be right in front of the heater to feel anything. I wanted something affordable that was not powered by propane however they do say u get what you paid for."", ""I bought two of these for my garage and disregarded the previous reviews i read. The fan barely puts air out. It gets hot, but the fan almost seems like the motor is junk. I'll still use it. I'll just put a box fan behind it so it can actually move heat around."", ""The heater is built well and is safe however its useless in a garage or outdoors. I would recommend it for use in a indoor room or basement environment where it doesn't have to compete with more harsh temperatures. Not exactly what I was hoping for!"", 'This looks good in the pictures, but is a terrible heater. The forced air is a joke. Plus it does not get hot. With the thermostat on high, after 15 minutes, I could still hold my hand about six inches in front of the grill. Very disappointed.', 'I thought I was going to buy this to upgrade the heater I use at work in the shop. I ended up just putting it in my car that I’m working on on the side of my house. It gets to about 80° inside just a car. I don’t expect it would be able to heat the shop. The fan is very weak as well.', 'It is good product for the price, it is slow on heating a large area but keeps it at a good temperature.', 'It came in a timely manner and works great as long as its pointed at you.

I love how quiet the heater is and how it spreads heat around a room without having a hot area only in front of the heater.  It is also lightweight and safe as the heater itself stays cool, and it has a tip over safety feature as well.', 'These are no good heaters. I have had to replace one every 4 winters, due to it just stops working. They show they are getting power, but the fan and heat does not come on. One year two went out the same way. For the price you pay you would think you are getting a well made product.

It is very quiet, it heats a bathroom very quickly from around 50 to 75 in just a few minutes. Of course the larger the room the longer it will take, but it ""throws"" heat nicely.  It feels very well built compared to other, admittedly cheaper, heaters i\'ve had in the past. I think the best compliment is, you don\'t even notice it\'s there, it just works.', 'This is the second Vornado that we have purchased. The first one only lasted 22 years! Does a fine job of heating a small room. Fan is relatively quiet. Only complaint is that it collects dust on the fan blades. Case is sealed so there is no way other than perhaps compressed air to clean the blades.', 'My old oil filled heater went out so I purchased this Vornado after so many good reviews.  It works okay but I thought it would put out more heat.  If I had to do this over again I would say no.', 'What I saw is what I got: pictures were accurate but also the consumer reviews I looked up.

14 X 21 IN ELECTRIC FOOT MAT WARMER Keep Feet Warm Office Space Heater Indoor,65.75,60-day returns,"[""In a Northern state, I've got an expensive office and the brilliant engineers designed a heating system with freezing cold floors. Not only that, constantly getting in and out of the car means inevitable snow on one's shoes in bad weather. This is a prescription for cold feet.This product is ideal for the job. Made of rubber so it's impervious to water or stains, cranks out the heat on high and trolls along beautiful on low. Plus, it's good size, bigger than the cheapie models so you don't have to think about where your feet are placed. Great value and highly recommended."", ""This rubber mat is excellent. I use it under my desk to keep my feet warm. It gets very hot. I believe around 135 degrees is what the mat heats up to. So this isn't some cheap mat that kinda gets warm.You can use it to warm your boots up also. The mat is injection molded one piece so it is water proof also. Would probably work great at the front door to melt snow or ice also."", ""Bought because our 70 yr. old house hardwood floors aren't insulated. This product is durable heats evenly perfect on cold nights to keep my feet warm in front of the tv. Did put down a piece of cardboard beneath the mat and floor as suggested by a previous purchaser's comment do not know if necessary. Have been using for weeks works great waterproof is a bonus, easy to keep clean.      arkansas"", 'The foot warmer arrived in a large, flat cardboard carton. Its switch (from high to low wattage and off) works well. This is the second one I have bought, both not for my feet but for my outdoor dogs/cats. Though it was not guaranteed for pets it works well in dog houses when the temperature is at 10 degrees F. Since it is sturdy for standing on with work shoes it also is tough enough for cats and dogs to sleep on. I put a special wrap on the AC wire to it to prevent animals from damaging the cord and usually use it at the low wattage setting. It is much more sturdy than the electric pet pads that are being sold.', 'My significant other has an office area just outside of our main house, the floor is cold and so were her feet until we put one of these mats under her desk and another by her photo tent.  Now her feet are warm and she is happy, so am I.  The wide range of heat settings and heavy construction make this a good purchase.', ""It's perfect!!!We live in Wisconsin with cold winter day's and night's. Hot water heat in our home so under the table gets real chilly because of having tile flooring.This unit is great because its warm enough to feel, yet not so warm you need to keep turning it on and off.I was also happy to see it had a lighted on/off switch about in the middle of the cord.If your legs ever get cool or cold under a desk or table, buy this unit!!!I wish I had it years ago and saved on the electric bill for the small heater I was using."", 'I repair watches my semi finished basement and I  have struggled trying to keep my feet and legs warm as my bench is against an outside wall. Have had an unheated rubber pad on the floor and it helped somewhat but this electric pad is great, l can actually sit in comfort even without shoes or extra pairs of socks.  Actually warms the air space for my legs too! Only used it for a few weeks but I am very impressed. Hope it lasts a long time.', ""It's a little hot for my feet in socks so I just folded up a bath floor towel into 1/4's and it's perfect in my basement office during the winter. I also use it with a Woods 50030 Indoor Countdown Timer so I never have to worry about leaving it on. Great product."", 'Take your shoes off and enjoy this foot pad on the coldest of days!!! Nice! And it has a handy on/off switch half way up the cord!!', ""I bought two of these foot warmers. One in March and one in May 2021.March purchased died in aprx September.May purchased survived till March 2022.Both were once placed under the table and never moved, so it's not a miss-use or broken cable. We always switched them off after several hours of use.Make your own judgment if it's acceptable. I don't think so.On the bright side - when it works it, well, works, keeping your feet warm.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

200 Watts Animal Heater Cozy Safe Chicken Coop Heater Safer Than Brooder Lamp,68.99, ,"[""We have made a shelter in our garage for a feral cat that we have been feeding for quite a while. It comes into our garage and goes upstairs to an attic . This heater keeps the little shelter box warm and cozy. It works from radiant heat and does not get hot enough to burn anything so I don't have to be concerned about fires. It doesn't use a lot of electricity and works great!"", 'I would not recommend this product for use in a coop. I bought it to use in a 4\'x6\'x3\' coop and it raised the inside temperature by approximately 10 degrees... not very helpful when the outside temperature averages 10 degrees or less all winter. I tried it in the house first and the temperature sticker (heat sensor) glowed after a few minutes. Once I put it outside, the sticker hasn\'t glowed at all and the chicken\'s water has frozen twice - despite being within inches of the heater. I\'m sure it would be fine for indoor brooding, or even in warmer climates, but if you live ""up north"" where winters are long &amp; cold I would definitely look into something which produces significantly more heat.', ""Great for a small indoor space with not a lot of movement of the air.  It doesn't put out a tremendous amount of heat and can actually be touched without any real discomfort. Would be great for a small chicken coop or a heated animal enclosure (like a dog or cat house) but the switch is not waterproof and neither is the heat panel, so avoid wet situations."", 'Warm safe indoor outdoor type of heater that uses little electricity and since it uses little energy it can also run on a small emergency inverter great peace of mind', 'I have no chickens.....I do have an old house that\'s a 100 years old.....Little drafty in a few places... And, I\'m loving these....The low cost to operate hardly taking any space at all to be used in and just taking a chill out of the air....Well my ""Cock"" is gonna be happy this Winter....', ""easy to use, safe, and doesn't take up a lot of room.  It is however hot to the touch unlike it says!"", 'Works great. Only draws 200 watts. Delivered quickly. Chickens love it.', 'Use it inside for my cockatiel. Note that the bird has to be pretty close (within 5-6 inches) to the for them to feel heat but I am very happy with it. It would work outside with my chickens if they needed it.', ""I won't be running this heater all the time, but there are nights here that go below freezing. I've had chicken's combs freeze before, and it's not pretty. This will keep the coop above freezing, and solve the problem! It mounts on the wall, and it's easy to clean. GREAT product~~~"", 'Amazed, after reading a couple other reviews, but mine arrived intact, and is working perfectly, in some really cold conditions.  I have it in a very small coop, but with -35 temps, it is keeping it fine for my girls!Very happy, so far....knock on wood!']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).
