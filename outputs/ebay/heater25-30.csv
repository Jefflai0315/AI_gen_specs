Lasko Ceramic Element Fan And Heater Oscillating Temp and Timer Space Heating,28.25, ,"['I giving it 4 stars because when I started it for the first time.. It gave weird smell for about an hour or so. After that it has been working excellent. Its very easy to setup. Nothing much needed, just plug and start. It comes with a remote control using which we can control the temperature and speed. When I was at graduate school, my friend used to have it for his room since that room used to be cold in our apartment. It used to work fine there, so I purchased for my room at my current apartment. ', ""I really haven't had to use it yet, for my apartment gets very warm because of the sun coming in on my windows which face west, but I did try it out and it is certainly easy to use."", 'This is an awesome heater for the price that I have paid.Pros:1. It can warm up the room quickly with different temperature setup2. It has the auto feature where it goes to sleep mode when the temperature in room reaches the set value and restarts whenever it goes lower beyond the set value3. It can oscillate like a tower fan and distribute the heat across the room4. Its light weightCons:1. It has the remote but during night you cant see the temperature that we have set on this humidifier. Having a display in the remote or on the humidifier itself', ""This is the second one I've purchased. The heater itself is a good value, and the oscillating feature, and remote control are an added bonus. Used my first purchase in my camper (2 years and still going strong). This one's for our home's enclosed porch."", ""I think the heater works well, But when you have a power outage you have to reset it to keep area warm. The controls don't allow it to pick up where, hear left off trying to heat area.   So that make this heater, not reliable for keeping kids warm, pets,  plants.  In the areas I have lived would even help prevent frozen water lines.  I makes heater like this only good for you if, your attending it.  If this heat had manual controls it would be better. or had a program to reboot and maintain a pre-set temp,  by factory or,  by the user.  Myself I like a electric  heater that works  as lone as I have power.  And  starts back up after a power outage.  Have a great day."", ""This heater doesn't oscillate on all the temperatures. Only oscillates from 75 and up."", 'Got this heater for my camp trailer. Might as well use a candle for heat.  . It would be fine if it had a fan inside it. Cant use it will look for something else that blows the heat out . Very disappointed !', 'I wish I could set temperature between 65 and 70, otherwise very good heater', ""What can you say, they are quite, thermostat adjustable, put out a tremendous amount of heat for their size, timered, remote control and oscillates.With out question best heaters that are portable I've ever owned."", 'When my other heater died I ordered the Lasko heater because I know that Lasko products are well made and have a good reputation. I am enjoying the heater in my some what cool basement music room. The features are great. With temperature control and timer. I could not ask for anything better.']","Open box: An item in excellent, new condition with no wear.

Lasko Digital Ceramic Heater 1500 Watts CC13700 * used * ,25, ,"['My Lasko CC13700 was manufactured Feb 2019 Purchased 11/11/19 from a local store. This was made in China where forced labor is documented but Lasko’s Social Responsibility statement addresses that issue: “Lasko and its affiliates will not work with any suppliers that engage in human trafficking and/or slavery.” The CC13700 seemed like it had an unusually strong odor new out of the box while it was heating. The heat was great but using it with the odor in the living area brought some unpleasant upper respiratory irritation and potential health issues that go along with that. After it aired out during the first year, the odor was not as noticeable in a well-ventilated area. At the end of the second season, it began to shut off immediately after turning on. It was under warranty so I sent an email to customer service and got a helpful reply the same evening. The suggestion of blowing air into the unit from the outside was a temporary fix for a few months but the heater eventually stopped blowing heat again so I submitted a warranty request. Due to the Lasko heater breakdown, I bought a new baseboard-style heater (without the chemical odor) before getting the replacement. Lasko Consumer Services stood behind the 3 year warranty. CC13700 was on back order and not available so they offered a different model. I did not have to pay return shipping and received a replacement fan heater within 15 days. It’s great to have to have a new Lasko fan heater, but it reintroduces the same indoor air pollution so I’m using this one away from the bedroom and main living areas to give it a year to air out. Regarding the CC13700 magnetic field, I checked it with a Triaxial ELF Magnetic Field Meter and found that the magnetic field from the motor was almost 48” in all directions, so I kept that in mind to maintain some distance while the heater was in use. The closed design with easy-vacuum filter is a nice innovation compared with open design fan heaters. Weekly filter vacuuming was essential to keep the plastic case cool and AC plug prongs from getting too hot in the outlet. I wish I could give the CC13700 more than 2 stars because it was excellent at putting out heat but apparently it wasn’t built to last. I think a heater should work for 5 years to earn a 5 star rating but this stopped working in less than 2 years. Fortunately there was a 3 year warranty and Lasko handled the warranty replacement very well (but the replacement heater deserves separate review because it is a different product and model number.) If the CC13700 could be repaired and used again, I would be open to editing the review with a higher rating because it was great before it stopped working. This was powerful and it produced instant hot air: I set Automatic Temperature Control about 15 degrees lower than expected to get the desired level of heat. (CC13700 digital temperature at the floor reads lower than other thermometers that I have and since heat rises, it might take several hours to raise floor temperature one degree in a small room, even with the door shut, while temperature 5 feet above the heater may be 10-20 degrees higher than what is shown on the display.) At first I didn’t like the CC13700 because it has an ergonomic design flaw that took awhile to get used to, in which placing the fingers under the carry handle makes it feel like it might be easy to tip over or drop. Regarding the digital controls: Pressing the red On button starts the heater on Hi setting. The 2 left buttons activate Automatic Temperature Control with digital setting range from 39F-90F (which must be set with the heater turned on and running). After selecting temperature, the DIGITAL DISPLAY FLASHES SEVERAL TIMES. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DO ANYTHING ELSE AT THAT POINT. Wait for the display to return to indicate the current room temperature and the Automatic Temperature Control should be set.  Automatic Temperature Control seems to have 3 degree temperature window which raises the temperature 2 degrees above the thermostat setting and drops one degree below before resuming operation. AC power interruption resets digital features to factory default. Pressing the middle timer button reveals 9 settings to set the timer between 1-8 hours or continuous. Adjustable louver control for directional heat is a nice feature made possible by the closed design.', 'Ordered 2 heaters,Wanted to send them back because they were way  to small,but I deceived to try them and boy do they heat up,I got so worm I had to kick off the blankets in the middle of the night.For such a small heater they generate a lot of heat.', 'High temp trips my 20 amp breaker. works fine on low', 'heat my bathroom very well love it', 'This product heats the interior of a 36 foot Avion 5th wheel RV when the outside temperature is &gt;30 degrees F. It is safe and reliable.', 'Good', 'I bought this heater to help maintain a constant temperature for my birds. Before this one I tried 3 other kinds. This one is great and does exactly what it says!', ""This item DOES NOT have a safety shut off, if it tips over. I've tested it, laying it down on the front or back DOES NOT shut it off. I thought a shut off was required of all heaters."", 'great product and great price']",,Lasko CC13700,,,Electric,Portable Heater,Timer,,"Baseboard, Desk/Tabletop, Floor",2,1001-1500 W,Lasko,Digital,,,Forced Air/Fan,120 V,,,,,unknown,,,,,,None,unknown,,,Brass,,,,100 sq ft or Less,Black,,,Compliant,,,,,2-Way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8 hrs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Great for a small area to 'take the chill off' or use in addition to another space heater as it only uses 200 watts.

Comfort Zone CZ798BK Milkhouse Utility Heater with Steel Body,28, ,"[""While the product appears to be well-made, the utterly anemic airflow from the under-powered 2-blade fan means that only things within about 2 3' are going to actually get warm anytime soon after turning this thing on, even at the highest setting.  As a fan, it is a complete joke. The much smaller heater that died and that this one replaced put out at least twice as much useful heat, moved a lot more air, and would project it a solid 6' or more!  This heater is nice-looking, sort-of, if you like louvers, but is functionally inferior relative to it's size and stated wattage.  Thankfully, the bathroom I bought it for is very small and it is almost enough to do the job of warming the room during a shower, even if it isn't up to the task of warming up any significantly-sized space or room, such as a bedroom, unless left to run for an hour or more.

Comfort Zone CZQTV007BK 1500W Radiant Quartz Heater - Black,29.99, ,"[""This a very cost effective space heater to warm any area during a chilly winter, or - as we had during the early part of the Wisconsin spring - a slightly nippy start to spring. It works to warm a bedroom, normal sized living room (unsure of those with an open plan large setting), or a small area of a basement that you are working in. It has three settings, and has tip-over &amp; overheat protection. I like this product an awful lot, and thus I'll give it 4.5 stars. It does NOT have a remote, but I bought a separate one for that purpose. I am taking a half of a star off because EVEN though it does have tip over protection (meaning it shuts off in that case), it is slightly more easy to tip over than I thought it was. So if you have pets, it might NOT be the BEST idea to use it when they are out playing - NOT so much for safety sake, but to prevent your fur baby from getting injured stepping on it."", 'Works very well and set up takes only a few minutes...', ""This will be my last one.

Lasko MyHeat Personal Ceramic Heater Model 100 - 200 Watts,29.95,30-day returns,"['I bought this unit to build a yogurt maker.  My unit consumed 190 watts on a kill-a-watt meter.  This was much more heat than I needed.  I opened up the unit to see what I could change.  The internal connections are soldered.  I was quite surprised.  The heating element is center tap so it functions as two parallel heaters.  I cut a wire so I only use half the heater and it works very well.  It is a little over 100 watts now.   This could be used to make a dehydrator also.  I bought a $10 digital temperature to control this.  Yes I am an engineer but this project was easily within the capabilities of handy people.  Before messing with it the heater was surprisingly effective as a desk top heater or something like that to keep your hands warm.  Bear in mind the heat output is like that of two 100 watt incandescent light bulbs.  It has no tilt sensor so works in any attitude but does have an effective thermal switch that shuts it off.  ', 'Very simple little heater a bit taller then a coffie mug, the vent big as a baseball.  No adjustments, just an on/off switch puts out heat of around 150°F at 3"" away, 115° at 6"", 90° at 1 foot, 80° at 2 feet, which is great in  a small area, or spacific body parts (feet, face, hands or core) in a large area without worry of tripping breakers.  Just used my little cen-tech temperature gunto take the measurements.', 'I use this to heat my dog house.  I live in Iowa and so winter nights can be quite cold 5-6 months per year.  This is the 2nd one.  The first lasted 4 years.  Its very reliable.  I mount it on the outside of the dog house and direct the heat through a vent to the inside.  It works very well in the tough conditions I use it.   It puts out just the right amount of heat to heat the dog house without getting the inside to warm for the dog.  On cold nights my dog only comes out to eat, drink, and potty.  Then back in he goes.  As you can see my dog is spoiled. ', 'I just got this today and I already love it. At first I thought it was going to be a heater that filled a small room with heat but it does not, instead after some adjustment I have this tiny heater blowing on me while I sit at my computer desk to warm me up!.So really it should be blowing on you to get the ""Personal"" benefit out of it. would I recommend it? Defiantly yes! Especially for those cold days in cold rooms this Personal heater does make a difference!', 'Love this thing! It was just what I was looking for. Puts out great heat right where I need it. I keep it near for my chilly feet. Great quality and low cost to operate. The casing stays cool when operating too. Always use any heat device responsibly.I am so glad I made this purchase.', 'The Lasko 100 heater has worked very well since purchasing a month ago. I use it in a cool basement where I have my office and it has helped keep my feet and hands nice and toasty while on the computer. It also helps keep some of my tropical houseplants at a constant warmer temperature along with a plant light I am also using. It puts out a fair amount of heat and is surprisingly quiet. It has only two settings, off and on but that suits my needs very well. It never gets overly hot to the touch and is not top heavy so I do not worry about it tipping over. A bonus is that the little unit looks pretty good too and does not take up much space if that is a concern.', 'I have an office with limited power available.  A normal heater would blow the circuit breaker.  So, I needed a low power heater.  This is it.  It consumes 200 watts and the circuit breaker does not blow.  No it does not put out as much heat as the other heaters.  It consumes less energy and puts out less heat.  But, that was what I needed.  it was either this heater or nothing.  Keeps my feet warm.', 'this little heater did a great job, i bought it for my rv and it warmed it up in no time....not for winter use, but a great spring/fall supplement heater for those times you just want to take the dampness and chill out.', 'My office building does not allow space heaters that put out over 200 watts.  My office is cold, so I bought this small heater out of desperation.  It does not heat the office, but it definitely help me to stay warm when it is at my feet or on top of my desk while I am working.Grant G, Spokane Washington', 'i bought the heater for myself a month or so ago needing extra heat at night time. i was in a motorcycle accident and was paralyzed in 09 and im on blood thinners which in the winter you freexe. i put it on the table next to bed and i couldnt believe how much heat comes from this heater. anyways as far as the quality its great. the simple on off with no adjustment is perfect. if it gets too warm simply move it away a couple inches and vise versa. i think its a super nice heater for the price i highly recommend it. office, desktop, table top, night stand etc.... great little heater A1 in my book. brian']",,Lasko MyHeat 100,,"Ceramic,Plastic, Ceramic, Plastic",Electric,"Unit Heater, Electric Portable Heater, Ceramic","Thermostat,Mini,Handle,Nonslip BASE, Handle, Indoor, Cool-Touch Exterior, Portable, Automatic Shut-OFF!,Cool-Touch Exterior,Overheat Protection,Power Indicator, Portable,Remote Control,Cool-Touch Exterior,Overheat Protection, Power Indicator, Automatic Shut-OFF!, Cool-Touch Exterior,Overheat Protection,Portable,Remote Control, Heating, Energy Efficient, Mini, Remote Control, Overheat Protection, Heater, Cool-Touch Exterior,Portable",100,"Desk/Tabletop, Portable",1,200,Lasko,"Switch, Push Button, Switch,Touch, Touch",,,Convection,120 V,46013764409,,,,,4.3 in,,Not Applicable,,,None,,Less Than 2000 BTU,,Ceramic,,Not Applicable,,Under 150 sq ft,"lemon yellow, Green,Black, Black, Green, Off White",,,,,,,,,,Ceramic,,,,,,,,,,,,,24 Hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 Pack Handy Heater Personal Space Heater 350 Watts ,29.99, ,"['I purchased this heater for a very specific purpose. I needed a small heater to dry out a wood window sill for a window located in a bathroom shower (long story). This heater satisfied all of my requirements which included: small enough to fit in the space between the storm window and double hung window, generate enough heat to dry the space without over heating, have a thermostat, and operate continuously for a prolonged period of time. I have not had any problems operating this unit on a heavy duty extension cord (not recommended in instructions). This unit will automatically turn on and off as it reaches the temperature you set for the unit. It produces just enough heat to satisfy my need. Criticisms regarding the 12 hour time limit can be resolved by plugging this unit into a timer. When the power is shut off and then back on, the unit will run again for 12 hours intervals solving the problem of having to be present to restart the unit. This unit must be suspended to prevent blockage of the air intake located on the bottom of the heater.', ""Quality feels good, not cheap. Plug rotation feature is secure and not wobbly or junky at all. Heater pulls 297 watts when running, but pulls ~750 watts for about 30 seconds when you turn it on from cold. This is a powerful little heater, you would not want to put your hand directly in front of it for very long. Definitely enough to heat a very small space like a car, or heat up a small room which isn't quite warm enough. Has a thermostat which works well. The heater will run the fan for a bit and cycle down just as it should. It has a red LED which always stays on and give the impression of a hot surface so that you don't forget that the grill could still be hot.The heater sucks air in from the bottom where the fan is.Honestly, this thing has better construction and features than most space heaters I've owned.Cannot yet speak to reliability but based on the good circuit design it should last quite a long time."", 'We have an L shaped bath room and the  baseboard heater is on the long side.

I also bought one for my daughter to use in her tack room for two barn cats but she is also disappointed because of the 12 hour turn off feature.  Only useful if you are there to turn it back on and reset every 12 hours.', 'While this thinks key feature is size, It works well.

"Honeywell HeatBud Ceramic Space Heater with Two Heat Settings, Black ",28.99, ,"[""What a load of rubbish.  I bought this item new in it's box.  I first unwound the electric cable added the adaptor and switched it on only for it to immediately blow up.  Thinking I may have made a mistake in the connectivity, and I really wanted one of these little heaters, I purchased a second identical item from the same source, and this also went bang in switching it on.  This even though I had bought new custom connector/converter for this item.  I am now a great many pounds out of pocket with nothing to show for my efforts."", ""This silent, compact heater has a feature to shut off if it's tipped.  It heats the confined area under my desk evenly.  Great product."", ""This was a small heater, with low wattage and an attractive price. I was  pleased to find out that it is made well and works great. I purchased a second small heater and it had fancier features than this one. However it died on me just two weeks after I purchased it. So I highly recommend this Honeywell heater for people needing a small heater for a camper or trailer. It heats well and at 600 watts, you can't lose. "", 'I bought this small heater mainly for my planned trip next Jan. Since auto heater comes very slow in the morning. I will use this heater with a inverter to speed up windshield defrost process because this electric heater will be instant on to do the job. ', ""It's small, convenient and warms you well."", 'Needed low wattage for off grid use in my little travel trailer. Perfect!!  Keeps my head and nose from getting too cold so i can save on propane use for heat.  Well made. Great value!!', 'It only takes a few minutes for the small heater to make my bathroom toasty. It’s of good quality and easy to use.', 'Had one before this, it heats up my small house I built for my outdoor cats, lasted allmost 3 months runing all the time before it died out. Pretty impressive for 20$.. heat is as expected for something of its size and power.', 'works well, 2 heat settings and auto off if it tips over. Would be nice if it had a ""thermostat"" to turn on &amp; off with a certain temp but for this price it\'s fantastic! It heats a nice 2-3\' ""bubble"" in the area immediately around it.', 'This was a great purchase for me. I used it under my desk during this last frigid blast, and it kept my feet nice and toasty. Very quiet. Nice gentle warmth.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Lasko My Heat Personal Space Ceramic Heater Model 102 Blue Electric New Open Box,26.99, ,"[""This is a great little PERSONAL heater.  You need to direct it to the exact spot you want warmth.

The last one I had lasted 2 winters."", ""I bought one of these years ago and it still works great. Now they're like $10 times the price in stores than what I paid 10 years ago.

"", ""I like the lasko personal heater it's nice and small and warms up my bathroom just right so I can take a nice comfortable bath or shower.  I'm in joying it during this cold weather.  I'm glad I purchased it and I'm really happy. Lasko  Great products. "", ""I already have two of these.  Great for a small area to 'take the chill off' or use in addition to another space heater as it only uses 200 watts.

Heater Honeywell 360 degree Surround Fan Forced HZ-0360,26.99, ,"['Very efficient small heater.  Heats up fast and doesn\'t create any kind of ""blowing"" sensation - just heats the air around it to a toasty warmth.  The unit shuts off automatically whenever it\'s knocked or tipped over, so I\'m not afraid to leave it around unsupervised cats.My only issue is that I\'ve tripped my surge protector a couple of times when shutting the unit off (because of the knob feature, you have to select-through the fan setting to get from the heat settings to the off position).  I assume this is because of the outlet distribution and wiring in my house, but I now prefer to tip the unit (so that it shuts off immediately) instead of turning the knob to turn it off.  Not a difficult adaptation for a powerful little space heater.', 'I bought this unit after doing some research for one for my laundry room. I have a house in the mountains and it has an added on laundry room without heating in it. Needless to say last winter I went thru two instances of pipes freezing in there. Well after doing the research and searching Ebay I found this unit at a very reasonable price and bought it. Since I got it we have had two very cold storms here and in my worries of the room I have gone down and checked and sure enough its keeping the room at a nice comfortable temperature !! It works great !! Now if I can only find a way to keep the snow from piling up in front of the door everything will be wonderful !!!!!', 'It does a great job heating a 10x12 room.Critique 1But it not a heater you can snuggle up to as it draws cold air in from the bottom.Critique 2Honeywell put tamper proof screws where you cannot take it apart to clean out the dust as should be done periodically to prevent a dust fire.Critique3You may buy &amp; return several of these to get one that heats on the highest setting as it appears that Honeywell set the overheat shutoff so low that it will not operate on the highest setting.Critique4After the overheat function turns the heater off you have to wait at least an hour for it to reset.', 'Very good product but a bit noisy.  The heat is very dry but it works really well.  Sit it between to large rooms and it will heat both or sit it in the hallway and it heats the whole up stairs.', 'This unit is designed well, takes up little space, and is much smaller than it looks. I bought it to warm a bed room with an old heat register that does not work. It warms the room (14X16) very well, even on the low power setting.  The only issue I have with it is that it is noisy.  A lot more so than I expected.  This would be a good product to purchase to run during the day, but at night in a bed room the fan is just too noisy.  Better to have a quiet radiant heater in the bed room than this product.', 'Does not work well , save your money, buy Master Heater MH-515-120 1500w/120v Turbo Electric Heater. Real good.', 'Exactly what we needed for the space we had.. Recommend highly!!', ""It's a heater what can I say? Well it did not blow heat as much as I thought it would.

Vornado EH1009106 Fan Heater - Brand New, , ,"['I live in Nebraska and put the Vornado in a 25’x12’ ventless corner basement room with 4 windows. It works adequately for that room. It takes 10-15 minutes on the high setting to heat entire room so I can’t imagine ever using the low setting there. Maybe in a smaller room or camper or a warmer climate it would be needed. The Vornado is so quiet and the heating element hardly glows, that when first turned on I wasn’t sure it was working. It has a safety switch on the bottom and needs to be placed on a hard flat surface. It’s very compact and the plastic exterior makes it lightweight. That exterior though doesn’t seem real sturdy so I’ve got it up off the floor to avoid getting kicked or trod on. For the price and purpose I’m satisfied.', ""After searching for a year for a replacement for our beloved Braun heater we have finally found one that works well. The Vornado is not the design leader that the old Braun was but it does come close on one of the most important features for us. We use this heater in a quiet office environment, therefore the heater has to be quiet. We tried a popular Fasco, a Caframo that is styled after the Braun, and other brands. All were too noisy. The Vornado is not whisper silent like the Braun, but it come close. The noise level is about like a modern computer.Other features we like on the Vornado are the 3 heat settings, a fairly accurate thermostat and a decent length cord. The design is upright where the Braun was low. The vertical design with the large blade fan helps the Vornado more more air which helps warm up the room more quickly. It has a discrete small red led light that lets you know it's on. The heater is made in China.The downsides of this heater are minor. The heat range selector switch is not intuitive and dimly marked. You need to shine a light on it and maybe consult the manual to remember what the cryptic I, II, III markings mean. (I=low, II=med, III=high). And the case is shiny plastic which is a static electricity magnet. It attracts dust and animal hair easily. These are small issues. We normally leave the unit on one heat setting and it is under the desk, so pretty much out of sight. The black case helps it hide. Overall the heater looks to be well made and it's doing its job well. The price is a little high for a simple heater, but we are happy with it."", ""This is the third one of these I have bought. While it has a maximum of 1500 watts, these heat a room the most evenly of anything you can buy. It is quiet and you won't get burned like other heaters. "", ""This is my second Vornado fan I've purchased. My first one is still working perfectly but I never want to be without one and may use this second one when I travel.  I live in a rental suite that is chilly in Spring and Fall. Despite how benign this fan looks it produces a significant amount of heat.  I only start the day running this heater on the 1000 Watt (medium) setting and then turn down to low for the remainder of the day. It heats my open floor plan living room and dining room exceptionally well without driving up the electrical bill. Cheaper than running the furnace or my natural gas fireplace (altho come winter we use that in conjunction with the heater fan).  Bear in mind this is the most reliable model. Other models of heater fans by Vornado do not have the longevity of this one yet still cost as much or more. Read the reviews and choose this model for great value."", ""This little room heater is outstanding. I bought it for my daughter's bedroom is she's on the second floor and as we heat with wood sometimes your room cools down below normal during the winter. This little heater keeps her room nice and toasty I would recommend it"", 'Heats the bedroom up quickly. Like the thermostat settings to keep room at even temp.', 'Compact size  heats a room in no time at all   I love it', 'Compact size', 'Quiet efficient small size unit=Love it', 'Vornado heaters are the only ones that I use, as they are dependable, quiet, and safe!  This one is the quietest one I have ever had and, like all Vornado heaters, warms my bedroom in about 2 minutes.

"Lasko 1500W Bathroom Space Heater w/ Timer and ALCI Safety Plug, CD08200, White",29.65, ,"[""I put this bathroom heater in my bedroom to compare with another good Lasko room heater of similar size and the same 1500 W but with different features. I like the angle of the heat blast from this bathroom heater better for when I'm sitting on my bed getting dressed in front of the heater, I am happier with the other in my office. which has a steeper angle of blast and a thermostat.I also use this bathroom heater in the bathroom for which it was intended. I wanted it above the sink level for safety, as there's nowhere else to put the heater but on the sink counter.  I  turned a fire safe small ceramic square kleenex holder upside down, and the heater's feet fit nicelyinside.This bathroom heater is convenient because of the one press button for a preset one hour of high heat for quick warmups such as in the bathroom or when getting dressed. No fussing with buttons. It also has High and Low settings that run without a timer.I also noticed that some sellers were saying their heaters were OK for the bathroom but the actual manufacturer did not.  This Bathroom heater is designed for the bathroom.  I'm not sure if the tripper in the cord is necessary if the outlet has one too, as many houses do these days in any water environment such as the bathroom or the kitchen.  I'm guessing the tripper in the plug reacts to the unit rather than the wall socket."", ""This heater does an excellent job of putting out a lot of air with the fan and also Heats the room excellently. For my application I'm using it in a fifth wheel trailer bathroom which is fairly small but one of the problems I'm having with the heater is I'm using a different thermostat on it that is more accurate to turn on and off and the heater shuts off and doesn't come back on when I use the thermostat on it so what you need to do is put something on the round button on top of the heater and tape it down to hold the button down all the time so that thermostat that I've got set up works properly and we'll kick the heater on when the temperature drops or more so when I want to heat the bathroom during a certain time of the day like when I take a shower.Otherwise the heater is an excellent heater and I would highly recommend anybody to buy it very good quality."", 'The heater is modern in design. It has a one hour feature that I love. I turn it on , shower get dressed in a warm bathroom, never have to wonder if I left it running. It automatically shuts off after 1 hour.', ""1. easy to turn on and off2. heats up fast3. has 1-hour auto shutoff4. very sturdy design, not likely to tip over5. made for humid areas like bathroomsbonus: it's cute!"", ""Here's the story:  To have my small bathroom warm when I get up in the morning for my shower, I had a small ceramic 1500 Watt heater connected into a wall timer to turn on automatically, and if I forgot (which I often did) to turn off automatically. With this Lasko heater, I tap the top when I'm ready to shower and it turns on high for one hour. Firstly, I don't have to remember to turn it off. Secondly, the velocity of the hot air coming out is so high that the bathroom heats up much quicker than my other heater, even though the wattage of both units is the same. This saves my electric bill.It seems to be good, quality wise, but it's only a month old now so we'll see.  November, 2020A note:  After it's turned off, and the top button (the big and only one) is tapped, it starts at the timed one hour 1500 Watt setting automatically."", ""It is difficult to find a space heater that is specifically for bathroom use. I was happy to find this one at this price and good reviews! It does exactly what I need it to do, I warm up my bathroom before a shower as my heat does not do that well - North side of house in Wisconsin! I will see how it holds up this winter, but so far very pleased with it's performance."", 'Works great! Instant heat . Small size is great. Comes with wet location plug  &amp; cord', ""Perfect replacement for my old heater that finally died. Small, lightweight, gets super warm in my little bathroom. Like that it's specifically made to use in a bathroom. Warming, the front grill can get hot!"", 'This little heater has all the power i need to heat up the bathroom in a hurry.
