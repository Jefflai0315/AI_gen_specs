Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,73.29,281 sold,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!  More than pleased hubby here...........""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681),51.3, ,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product? It really depends upon your application need. I put this in my truck due to no floor board heat. It does help but the heat is so so at best. The blow power is very minimal but it does help for my application']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

I have never had any problem with this heater and I would never go thru a winter without a couple of them. I always try to have a back up to what I use the most of, so I won't be without one working, just in case. They put out excellent heat in my room size of 15' X 24'. Also great if the power ever was to go out for a while during cold times. When the heater is fired up and the mantle is all glowing without any flame going higher than the mantle, I notice very little kerosene smell. Mine have been a life saver over the years that I've owned them. Bruce; TN."", ""I was not happy when I first got this heater.  The flame adjustment was only usable when it is in the all the way up position.  It should start out high and then after it mellows out you adjust it down.  Also the fumes were terrible!  I could not use it indoors.  I had tried it 3 times and would have sent it back but as it was heavy and a large box I just didn't want the hassle.  I pulled it off the back porch last night for one last try.  It worked great!  I stood right over it and inhaled and no fumes at all!  I was using K1 kero at 4.99 a gallon for indoor use.  So...it could be when a heater is new it has to burn a few tanks to get to where it needs to be.

Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,73.29,281 sold,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!  More than pleased hubby here...........""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681),51.3,94 sold,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product? It really depends upon your application need. I put this in my truck due to no floor board heat. It does help but the heat is so so at best.

I have never had any problem with this heater and I would never go thru a winter without a couple of them. I always try to have a back up to what I use the most of, so I won't be without one working, just in case. They put out excellent heat in my room size of 15' X 24'.

The flame adjustment was only usable when it is in the all the way up position.  It should start out high and then after it mellows out you adjust it down.  Also the fumes were terrible!  I could not use it indoors.  I had tried it 3 times and would have sent it back but as it was heavy and a large box I just didn't want the hassle.  I pulled it off the back porch last night for one last try.  It worked great!  I stood right over it and inhaled and no fumes at all!  I was using K1 kero at 4.99 a gallon for indoor use.

Dr. Heater 240 Volt 5600 Watt Garage Workshop Portable Industrial Space Heater,75.99,130 sold,"['This does all I need for taking the chill off our two bay shop at ""Coop\'s Miata"" in Maple Valley Washington.It is quiet and efficient. The only negative thing is the short chord and the odd plug. I had to make a 20 ft extension chord with adaptation for my shop 240 service. Ended up changing the plug on the heater chord as well.  Couldn\'t find a chord female plug for this style. Worked out that I ended up using the same mail plug I use for my Tig. Word of caution: use the right gauge wire and keep it less than 25 feet.', ""I purchased this heater in 01/2013 to replace a propane bottle heater.  It is much safer than propane and the fan circulates the heat.  I have been extremely happy with this heater as it has worked great to heat my insulated garage/shop during the cold N. IL winters.  I gave it four stars due to the fact that the fan motor uses sleeve bearings and not ball so any dirt that accumulates on the blades causes vibration and wear on the bearings.  It is important to keep the fan blades clean to reduce wear and extend the life.  I suggest cleaning every season.  I just completed cleaning blades and fan bearings and the heater works like new again.  Very easy to do with just a few screws to remove cover and fan  Don't get me wrong this is a great heater for the price.  I will look into the model 966 which has a heavier duty fan when this wears out. "", ""Don't get me wrong they put out heat... But not like people brag about on them... If your in a two bay garage it will take the chill out in roughly in a hour with the door closed. Lots of 220 power used in an hr. If you put it beside you when working on a car in the open it cycles off and on the heating element a lot as if room temperature has been reached. Cold hot cold hot.... Wasn't worth adding a 220 outlet. Says industrial use only on the warning label on top, exactly what industry would have been nice to know... Because  commercial mechanic work does not qualify...."", ""I spent almost a couple hours reading and researching several heaters to help for winter work in the garage. My final decision in this unit was the power of the fan. It was much stronger BLOWER MOTOR than many others. It is built tough/rugged like (old school box style construction). I figured with the amount of electricity this draws and the fan strength, I'd get e bit more bang for the buck. I was wrong... I've seen more impressive 110 models in the past over this. Unfortunate results for the amount of electricity you pour out. It also has a horrible cool draft off one corner. How does a heater blow a cool breeze with the hot? (Maybe the blower is to strong for the heating element?) Even standing in front of this unit, It was not impressive on the heat being generated. If you don't care about electricity and need to blow a little bit of heat a distance then I would suggest this unit for you.... everyone else, I suggest researching other units."", 'When I received this heater the box was in perfect shape, no signs of damage, but when I opened it and pulled the heater out the fan was laying in the bottom not attached to the bracket inside. Pulled the cover off and screws totally missing, fan and inside of heater looked as if it had been running with the fan hitting inside of housing. Screws not inside the heater nor in the box. Got the fan straightened out and bought screws from hardware store, remounted fan and turned the heater on. It started working and seemed to be okay. The heater coil is not suppose to turn red while it is running however on day 2 the coil is starting to turn red while heating so the coil is not going to last very long before it shorts out. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time to work on it to get it running. If I had just wanted a fan I could have bought several fans from Walmart for what this cost.', ""Using on construction site.  Keeps 3 bedroom townhouses at 70 degrees.Bought 15 open box and 1 new.  Could not tell the difference.  One heater had a loose fan bracket.Tightened screws and it was good.  Another heater had a fan that rattled. Had some play on the drive shaft.  Added a washer and it was good as new.  Can't complain because they were 1/2 the price of new ones.  Wish they had a different plug.  A dryer or range end would be better."", 'This is to backup the same model in use for a couple years, they work very well. Only complaint is new one has a high pitched fan motor whine when the unit is not under a heat load with just the fan running.  ', 'An excellent buy. Good strong heat for  an old 20 x 20 wood garage with a high peak ceiling, and no insulation in very cold weather. Had to change the 30 amp 220v electrical receptacle, but that was it. Leave it on the floor, and it will do a good job.', 'Dr Infrared heater will work in a 600 foot building if it is insulated and dry walled temp 40F outdoors will stay 70-75 indoors easy I have a Gas heater , and use the Dr heater with it when it is 20 outdoors and keep it 70 indoors the Dr heat will turn on and off my gas keeps going . the last to days I left the gas go all night when I get to the Shop I turn dr heat on and turn the gas off from 7am to 5 pm the temp never got under 75 , it was 32 outdoors and got to 48 outdoors and I can turn Dr heater up or down to regulate the shop temp . Only had Dr heater 10 days . Its been a lot of help so far .', ""Good heater at a good price.  Bought this one to replace the same heater I've had for a couple of years.  Only complaint I have is that this heater does not come with a parts list for ordering replacement parts.  My previous heater had the control (rheostat?) go bad, and I couldn't find what part I needed to replace it.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,73.29,281 sold,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681),51.3,94 sold,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product?

I have never had any problem with this heater and I would never go thru a winter without a couple of them. I always try to have a back up to what I use the most of, so I won't be without one working, just in case. They put out excellent heat in my room size of 15' X 24'. Also great if the power ever was to go out for a while during cold times. When the heater is fired up and the mantle is all glowing without any flame going higher than the mantle, I notice very little kerosene smell. Mine have been a life saver over the years that I've owned them. Bruce; TN."", ""I was not happy when I first got this heater.  The flame adjustment was only usable when it is in the all the way up position.  It should start out high and then after it mellows out you adjust it down.  Also the fumes were terrible!  I could not use it indoors.  I had tried it 3 times and would have sent it back but as it was heavy and a large box I just didn't want the hassle.  I pulled it off the back porch last night for one last try.  It worked great!  I stood right over it and inhaled and no fumes at all!  I was using K1 kero at 4.99 a gallon for indoor use.

Dr. Heater 240 Volt 5600 Watt Garage Workshop Portable Industrial Space Heater,75.99,130 sold,"['This does all I need for taking the chill off our two bay shop at ""Coop\'s Miata"" in Maple Valley Washington.It is quiet and efficient. The only negative thing is the short chord and the odd plug. I had to make a 20 ft extension chord with adaptation for my shop 240 service. Ended up changing the plug on the heater chord as well.  Couldn\'t find a chord female plug for this style. Worked out that I ended up using the same mail plug I use for my Tig. Word of caution: use the right gauge wire and keep it less than 25 feet.', ""I purchased this heater in 01/2013 to replace a propane bottle heater.  It is much safer than propane and the fan circulates the heat.  I have been extremely happy with this heater as it has worked great to heat my insulated garage/shop during the cold N. IL winters.  I gave it four stars due to the fact that the fan motor uses sleeve bearings and not ball so any dirt that accumulates on the blades causes vibration and wear on the bearings.  It is important to keep the fan blades clean to reduce wear and extend the life.  I suggest cleaning every season.  I just completed cleaning blades and fan bearings and the heater works like new again.  Very easy to do with just a few screws to remove cover and fan  Don't get me wrong this is a great heater for the price.  I will look into the model 966 which has a heavier duty fan when this wears out. "", ""Don't get me wrong they put out heat... But not like people brag about on them... If your in a two bay garage it will take the chill out in roughly in a hour with the door closed. Lots of 220 power used in an hr. If you put it beside you when working on a car in the open it cycles off and on the heating element a lot as if room temperature has been reached. Cold hot cold hot.... Wasn't worth adding a 220 outlet. Says industrial use only on the warning label on top, exactly what industry would have been nice to know... Because  commercial mechanic work does not qualify...."", ""I spent almost a couple hours reading and researching several heaters to help for winter work in the garage. My final decision in this unit was the power of the fan. It was much stronger BLOWER MOTOR than many others. It is built tough/rugged like (old school box style construction). I figured with the amount of electricity this draws and the fan strength, I'd get e bit more bang for the buck. I was wrong... I've seen more impressive 110 models in the past over this. Unfortunate results for the amount of electricity you pour out. It also has a horrible cool draft off one corner. How does a heater blow a cool breeze with the hot? (Maybe the blower is to strong for the heating element?) Even standing in front of this unit, It was not impressive on the heat being generated. If you don't care about electricity and need to blow a little bit of heat a distance then I would suggest this unit for you.... everyone else, I suggest researching other units."", 'When I received this heater the box was in perfect shape, no signs of damage, but when I opened it and pulled the heater out the fan was laying in the bottom not attached to the bracket inside. Pulled the cover off and screws totally missing, fan and inside of heater looked as if it had been running with the fan hitting inside of housing. Screws not inside the heater nor in the box. Got the fan straightened out and bought screws from hardware store, remounted fan and turned the heater on. It started working and seemed to be okay. The heater coil is not suppose to turn red while it is running however on day 2 the coil is starting to turn red while heating so the coil is not going to last very long before it shorts out. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time to work on it to get it running. If I had just wanted a fan I could have bought several fans from Walmart for what this cost.', ""Using on construction site.  Keeps 3 bedroom townhouses at 70 degrees.Bought 15 open box and 1 new.  Could not tell the difference.  One heater had a loose fan bracket.Tightened screws and it was good.  Another heater had a fan that rattled. Had some play on the drive shaft.  Added a washer and it was good as new.  Can't complain because they were 1/2 the price of new ones.  Wish they had a different plug.

Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,73.29,281 sold,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!  More than pleased hubby here...........""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681),51.3,94 sold,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product? It really depends upon your application need. I put this in my truck due to no floor board heat. It does help but the heat is so so at best. The blow power is very minimal but it does help for my application']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Sengoku CTN-110 KeroHeat Portable Radiant Kerosene Space Heater, 10,000 BTU",184.98,20 sold,"[""I currently have a couple of these kerosene heaters and I like to rotate them out every so often, as to not let the wick from just one get all of the use over the winter season. I have never had any problem with this heater and I would never go thru a winter without a couple of them. I always try to have a back up to what I use the most of, so I won't be without one working, just in case. They put out excellent heat in my room size of 15' X 24'. Also great if the power ever was to go out for a while during cold times. When the heater is fired up and the mantle is all glowing without any flame going higher than the mantle, I notice very little kerosene smell. Mine have been a life saver over the years that I've owned them. Bruce; TN."", ""I was not happy when I first got this heater.  The flame adjustment was only usable when it is in the all the way up position.  It should start out high and then after it mellows out you adjust it down.  Also the fumes were terrible!  I could not use it indoors.  I had tried it 3 times and would have sent it back but as it was heavy and a large box I just didn't want the hassle.  I pulled it off the back porch last night for one last try.  It worked great!  I stood right over it and inhaled and no fumes at all!  I was using K1 kero at 4.99 a gallon for indoor use.  So...it could be when a heater is new it has to burn a few tanks to get to where it needs to be.

Dr. Heater 240 Volt 5600 Watt Garage Workshop Portable Industrial Space Heater,75.99,130 sold,"['This does all I need for taking the chill off our two bay shop at ""Coop\'s Miata"" in Maple Valley Washington.It is quiet and efficient. The only negative thing is the short chord and the odd plug. I had to make a 20 ft extension chord with adaptation for my shop 240 service. Ended up changing the plug on the heater chord as well.  Couldn\'t find a chord female plug for this style. Worked out that I ended up using the same mail plug I use for my Tig. Word of caution: use the right gauge wire and keep it less than 25 feet.', ""I purchased this heater in 01/2013 to replace a propane bottle heater.  It is much safer than propane and the fan circulates the heat.  I have been extremely happy with this heater as it has worked great to heat my insulated garage/shop during the cold N. IL winters.  I gave it four stars due to the fact that the fan motor uses sleeve bearings and not ball so any dirt that accumulates on the blades causes vibration and wear on the bearings.  It is important to keep the fan blades clean to reduce wear and extend the life.  I suggest cleaning every season.  I just completed cleaning blades and fan bearings and the heater works like new again.  Very easy to do with just a few screws to remove cover and fan  Don't get me wrong this is a great heater for the price.  I will look into the model 966 which has a heavier duty fan when this wears out. "", ""Don't get me wrong they put out heat... But not like people brag about on them... If your in a two bay garage it will take the chill out in roughly in a hour with the door closed. Lots of 220 power used in an hr. If you put it beside you when working on a car in the open it cycles off and on the heating element a lot as if room temperature has been reached. Cold hot cold hot.... Wasn't worth adding a 220 outlet. Says industrial use only on the warning label on top, exactly what industry would have been nice to know... Because  commercial mechanic work does not qualify...."", ""I spent almost a couple hours reading and researching several heaters to help for winter work in the garage. My final decision in this unit was the power of the fan. It was much stronger BLOWER MOTOR than many others. It is built tough/rugged like (old school box style construction). I figured with the amount of electricity this draws and the fan strength, I'd get e bit more bang for the buck. I was wrong... I've seen more impressive 110 models in the past over this. Unfortunate results for the amount of electricity you pour out. It also has a horrible cool draft off one corner. How does a heater blow a cool breeze with the hot? (Maybe the blower is to strong for the heating element?) Even standing in front of this unit, It was not impressive on the heat being generated. If you don't care about electricity and need to blow a little bit of heat a distance then I would suggest this unit for you.... everyone else, I suggest researching other units."", 'When I received this heater the box was in perfect shape, no signs of damage, but when I opened it and pulled the heater out the fan was laying in the bottom not attached to the bracket inside. Pulled the cover off and screws totally missing, fan and inside of heater looked as if it had been running with the fan hitting inside of housing. Screws not inside the heater nor in the box. Got the fan straightened out and bought screws from hardware store, remounted fan and turned the heater on. It started working and seemed to be okay. The heater coil is not suppose to turn red while it is running however on day 2 the coil is starting to turn red while heating so the coil is not going to last very long before it shorts out. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time to work on it to get it running. If I had just wanted a fan I could have bought several fans from Walmart for what this cost.', ""Using on construction site.  Keeps 3 bedroom townhouses at 70 degrees.Bought 15 open box and 1 new.  Could not tell the difference.  One heater had a loose fan bracket.Tightened screws and it was good.  Another heater had a fan that rattled. Had some play on the drive shaft.  Added a washer and it was good as new.  Can't complain because they were 1/2 the price of new ones.  Wish they had a different plug.  A dryer or range end would be better."", 'This is to backup the same model in use for a couple years, they work very well.

Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,73.29,281 sold,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681),51.3,94 sold,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product?

"Sengoku CTN-110 KeroHeat Portable Radiant Kerosene Space Heater, 10,000 BTU",184.98,20 sold,"[""I currently have a couple of these kerosene heaters and I like to rotate them out every so often, as to not let the wick from just one get all of the use over the winter season. I have never had any problem with this heater and I would never go thru a winter without a couple of them. I always try to have a back up to what I use the most of, so I won't be without one working, just in case. They put out excellent heat in my room size of 15' X 24'. Also great if the power ever was to go out for a while during cold times. When the heater is fired up and the mantle is all glowing without any flame going higher than the mantle, I notice very little kerosene smell. Mine have been a life saver over the years that I've owned them. Bruce; TN."", ""I was not happy when I first got this heater.  The flame adjustment was only usable when it is in the all the way up position.  It should start out high and then after it mellows out you adjust it down.  Also the fumes were terrible!  I could not use it indoors.  I had tried it 3 times and would have sent it back but as it was heavy and a large box I just didn't want the hassle.  I pulled it off the back porch last night for one last try.  It worked great!  I stood right over it and inhaled and no fumes at all!  I was using K1 kero at 4.99 a gallon for indoor use.  So...it could be when a heater is new it has to burn a few tanks to get to where it needs to be.  I am satisfied now but still wish the wick came up higher...but it is a good heater...you just have to burn it off a few times."", 'Work great no fumes and heats up a room with a tin roof and cement floor real good', 'Heater is amazing.

Dr. Heater 240 Volt 5600 Watt Garage Workshop Portable Industrial Space Heater,75.99,130 sold,"['This does all I need for taking the chill off our two bay shop at ""Coop\'s Miata"" in Maple Valley Washington.It is quiet and efficient. The only negative thing is the short chord and the odd plug. I had to make a 20 ft extension chord with adaptation for my shop 240 service. Ended up changing the plug on the heater chord as well.  Couldn\'t find a chord female plug for this style. Worked out that I ended up using the same mail plug I use for my Tig. Word of caution: use the right gauge wire and keep it less than 25 feet.', ""I purchased this heater in 01/2013 to replace a propane bottle heater.  It is much safer than propane and the fan circulates the heat.  I have been extremely happy with this heater as it has worked great to heat my insulated garage/shop during the cold N. IL winters.  I gave it four stars due to the fact that the fan motor uses sleeve bearings and not ball so any dirt that accumulates on the blades causes vibration and wear on the bearings.  It is important to keep the fan blades clean to reduce wear and extend the life.  I suggest cleaning every season.  I just completed cleaning blades and fan bearings and the heater works like new again.  Very easy to do with just a few screws to remove cover and fan  Don't get me wrong this is a great heater for the price.  I will look into the model 966 which has a heavier duty fan when this wears out. "", ""Don't get me wrong they put out heat... But not like people brag about on them... If your in a two bay garage it will take the chill out in roughly in a hour with the door closed. Lots of 220 power used in an hr. If you put it beside you when working on a car in the open it cycles off and on the heating element a lot as if room temperature has been reached. Cold hot cold hot.... Wasn't worth adding a 220 outlet. Says industrial use only on the warning label on top, exactly what industry would have been nice to know... Because  commercial mechanic work does not qualify...."", ""I spent almost a couple hours reading and researching several heaters to help for winter work in the garage. My final decision in this unit was the power of the fan. It was much stronger BLOWER MOTOR than many others. It is built tough/rugged like (old school box style construction). I figured with the amount of electricity this draws and the fan strength, I'd get e bit more bang for the buck. I was wrong... I've seen more impressive 110 models in the past over this. Unfortunate results for the amount of electricity you pour out. It also has a horrible cool draft off one corner. How does a heater blow a cool breeze with the hot? (Maybe the blower is to strong for the heating element?) Even standing in front of this unit, It was not impressive on the heat being generated. If you don't care about electricity and need to blow a little bit of heat a distance then I would suggest this unit for you.... everyone else, I suggest researching other units."", 'When I received this heater the box was in perfect shape, no signs of damage, but when I opened it and pulled the heater out the fan was laying in the bottom not attached to the bracket inside. Pulled the cover off and screws totally missing, fan and inside of heater looked as if it had been running with the fan hitting inside of housing. Screws not inside the heater nor in the box. Got the fan straightened out and bought screws from hardware store, remounted fan and turned the heater on. It started working and seemed to be okay. The heater coil is not suppose to turn red while it is running however on day 2 the coil is starting to turn red while heating so the coil is not going to last very long before it shorts out. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time to work on it to get it running. If I had just wanted a fan I could have bought several fans from Walmart for what this cost.', ""Using on construction site.  Keeps 3 bedroom townhouses at 70 degrees.Bought 15 open box and 1 new.  Could not tell the difference.  One heater had a loose fan bracket.Tightened screws and it was good.  Another heater had a fan that rattled. Had some play on the drive shaft.  Added a washer and it was good as new.  Can't complain because they were 1/2 the price of new ones.  Wish they had a different plug.  A dryer or range end would be better."", 'This is to backup the same model in use for a couple years, they work very well. Only complaint is new one has a high pitched fan motor whine when the unit is not under a heat load with just the fan running.  ', 'An excellent buy. Good strong heat for  an old 20 x 20 wood garage with a high peak ceiling, and no insulation in very cold weather. Had to change the 30 amp 220v electrical receptacle, but that was it. Leave it on the floor, and it will do a good job.', 'Dr Infrared heater will work in a 600 foot building if it is insulated and dry walled temp 40F outdoors will stay 70-75 indoors easy I have a Gas heater , and use the Dr heater with it when it is 20 outdoors and keep it 70 indoors the Dr heat will turn on and off my gas keeps going . the last to days I left the gas go all night when I get to the Shop I turn dr heat on and turn the gas off from 7am to 5 pm the temp never got under 75 , it was 32 outdoors and got to 48 outdoors and I can turn Dr heater up or down to regulate the shop temp .

Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,73.29,281 sold,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!  More than pleased hubby here...........""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681),51.3,94 sold,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product? It really depends upon your application need. I put this in my truck due to no floor board heat. It does help but the heat is so so at best.

I have never had any problem with this heater and I would never go thru a winter without a couple of them. I always try to have a back up to what I use the most of, so I won't be without one working, just in case. They put out excellent heat in my room size of 15' X 24'.

The flame adjustment was only usable when it is in the all the way up position.  It should start out high and then after it mellows out you adjust it down.  Also the fumes were terrible!  I could not use it indoors.  I had tried it 3 times and would have sent it back but as it was heavy and a large box I just didn't want the hassle.  I pulled it off the back porch last night for one last try.  It worked great!  I stood right over it and inhaled and no fumes at all!  I was using K1 kero at 4.99 a gallon for indoor use.

Dr. Heater 240 Volt 5600 Watt Garage Workshop Portable Industrial Space Heater,75.99,130 sold,"['This does all I need for taking the chill off our two bay shop at ""Coop\'s Miata"" in Maple Valley Washington.It is quiet and efficient. The only negative thing is the short chord and the odd plug. I had to make a 20 ft extension chord with adaptation for my shop 240 service. Ended up changing the plug on the heater chord as well.  Couldn\'t find a chord female plug for this style. Worked out that I ended up using the same mail plug I use for my Tig. Word of caution: use the right gauge wire and keep it less than 25 feet.', ""I purchased this heater in 01/2013 to replace a propane bottle heater.  It is much safer than propane and the fan circulates the heat.  I have been extremely happy with this heater as it has worked great to heat my insulated garage/shop during the cold N. IL winters.  I gave it four stars due to the fact that the fan motor uses sleeve bearings and not ball so any dirt that accumulates on the blades causes vibration and wear on the bearings.  It is important to keep the fan blades clean to reduce wear and extend the life.  I suggest cleaning every season.  I just completed cleaning blades and fan bearings and the heater works like new again.  Very easy to do with just a few screws to remove cover and fan  Don't get me wrong this is a great heater for the price.  I will look into the model 966 which has a heavier duty fan when this wears out. "", ""Don't get me wrong they put out heat... But not like people brag about on them... If your in a two bay garage it will take the chill out in roughly in a hour with the door closed. Lots of 220 power used in an hr. If you put it beside you when working on a car in the open it cycles off and on the heating element a lot as if room temperature has been reached. Cold hot cold hot.... Wasn't worth adding a 220 outlet. Says industrial use only on the warning label on top, exactly what industry would have been nice to know... Because  commercial mechanic work does not qualify...."", ""I spent almost a couple hours reading and researching several heaters to help for winter work in the garage. My final decision in this unit was the power of the fan. It was much stronger BLOWER MOTOR than many others. It is built tough/rugged like (old school box style construction). I figured with the amount of electricity this draws and the fan strength, I'd get e bit more bang for the buck. I was wrong... I've seen more impressive 110 models in the past over this. Unfortunate results for the amount of electricity you pour out. It also has a horrible cool draft off one corner. How does a heater blow a cool breeze with the hot? (Maybe the blower is to strong for the heating element?) Even standing in front of this unit, It was not impressive on the heat being generated. If you don't care about electricity and need to blow a little bit of heat a distance then I would suggest this unit for you.... everyone else, I suggest researching other units."", 'When I received this heater the box was in perfect shape, no signs of damage, but when I opened it and pulled the heater out the fan was laying in the bottom not attached to the bracket inside. Pulled the cover off and screws totally missing, fan and inside of heater looked as if it had been running with the fan hitting inside of housing. Screws not inside the heater nor in the box. Got the fan straightened out and bought screws from hardware store, remounted fan and turned the heater on. It started working and seemed to be okay. The heater coil is not suppose to turn red while it is running however on day 2 the coil is starting to turn red while heating so the coil is not going to last very long before it shorts out. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time to work on it to get it running. If I had just wanted a fan I could have bought several fans from Walmart for what this cost.', ""Using on construction site.  Keeps 3 bedroom townhouses at 70 degrees.Bought 15 open box and 1 new.  Could not tell the difference.  One heater had a loose fan bracket.Tightened screws and it was good.  Another heater had a fan that rattled. Had some play on the drive shaft.  Added a washer and it was good as new.  Can't complain because they were 1/2 the price of new ones.  Wish they had a different plug.  A dryer or range end would be better."", 'This is to backup the same model in use for a couple years, they work very well. Only complaint is new one has a high pitched fan motor whine when the unit is not under a heat load with just the fan running.  ', 'An excellent buy. Good strong heat for  an old 20 x 20 wood garage with a high peak ceiling, and no insulation in very cold weather. Had to change the 30 amp 220v electrical receptacle, but that was it. Leave it on the floor, and it will do a good job.', 'Dr Infrared heater will work in a 600 foot building if it is insulated and dry walled temp 40F outdoors will stay 70-75 indoors easy I have a Gas heater , and use the Dr heater with it when it is 20 outdoors and keep it 70 indoors the Dr heat will turn on and off my gas keeps going . the last to days I left the gas go all night when I get to the Shop I turn dr heat on and turn the gas off from 7am to 5 pm the temp never got under 75 , it was 32 outdoors and got to 48 outdoors and I can turn Dr heater up or down to regulate the shop temp . Only had Dr heater 10 days . Its been a lot of help so far .', ""Good heater at a good price.  Bought this one to replace the same heater I've had for a couple of years.  Only complaint I have is that this heater does not come with a parts list for ordering replacement parts.  My previous heater had the control (rheostat?) go bad, and I couldn't find what part I needed to replace it.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,73.29,281 sold,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681),51.3,94 sold,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product?

I have never had any problem with this heater and I would never go thru a winter without a couple of them. I always try to have a back up to what I use the most of, so I won't be without one working, just in case. They put out excellent heat in my room size of 15' X 24'. Also great if the power ever was to go out for a while during cold times. When the heater is fired up and the mantle is all glowing without any flame going higher than the mantle, I notice very little kerosene smell. Mine have been a life saver over the years that I've owned them. Bruce; TN."", ""I was not happy when I first got this heater.  The flame adjustment was only usable when it is in the all the way up position.  It should start out high and then after it mellows out you adjust it down.  Also the fumes were terrible!  I could not use it indoors.  I had tried it 3 times and would have sent it back but as it was heavy and a large box I just didn't want the hassle.  I pulled it off the back porch last night for one last try.  It worked great!  I stood right over it and inhaled and no fumes at all!  I was using K1 kero at 4.99 a gallon for indoor use.

Dr. Heater 240 Volt 5600 Watt Garage Workshop Portable Industrial Space Heater,75.99,130 sold,"['This does all I need for taking the chill off our two bay shop at ""Coop\'s Miata"" in Maple Valley Washington.It is quiet and efficient. The only negative thing is the short chord and the odd plug. I had to make a 20 ft extension chord with adaptation for my shop 240 service. Ended up changing the plug on the heater chord as well.  Couldn\'t find a chord female plug for this style. Worked out that I ended up using the same mail plug I use for my Tig. Word of caution: use the right gauge wire and keep it less than 25 feet.', ""I purchased this heater in 01/2013 to replace a propane bottle heater.  It is much safer than propane and the fan circulates the heat.  I have been extremely happy with this heater as it has worked great to heat my insulated garage/shop during the cold N. IL winters.  I gave it four stars due to the fact that the fan motor uses sleeve bearings and not ball so any dirt that accumulates on the blades causes vibration and wear on the bearings.  It is important to keep the fan blades clean to reduce wear and extend the life.  I suggest cleaning every season.  I just completed cleaning blades and fan bearings and the heater works like new again.  Very easy to do with just a few screws to remove cover and fan  Don't get me wrong this is a great heater for the price.  I will look into the model 966 which has a heavier duty fan when this wears out. "", ""Don't get me wrong they put out heat... But not like people brag about on them... If your in a two bay garage it will take the chill out in roughly in a hour with the door closed. Lots of 220 power used in an hr. If you put it beside you when working on a car in the open it cycles off and on the heating element a lot as if room temperature has been reached. Cold hot cold hot.... Wasn't worth adding a 220 outlet. Says industrial use only on the warning label on top, exactly what industry would have been nice to know... Because  commercial mechanic work does not qualify...."", ""I spent almost a couple hours reading and researching several heaters to help for winter work in the garage. My final decision in this unit was the power of the fan. It was much stronger BLOWER MOTOR than many others. It is built tough/rugged like (old school box style construction). I figured with the amount of electricity this draws and the fan strength, I'd get e bit more bang for the buck. I was wrong... I've seen more impressive 110 models in the past over this. Unfortunate results for the amount of electricity you pour out. It also has a horrible cool draft off one corner. How does a heater blow a cool breeze with the hot? (Maybe the blower is to strong for the heating element?) Even standing in front of this unit, It was not impressive on the heat being generated. If you don't care about electricity and need to blow a little bit of heat a distance then I would suggest this unit for you.... everyone else, I suggest researching other units."", 'When I received this heater the box was in perfect shape, no signs of damage, but when I opened it and pulled the heater out the fan was laying in the bottom not attached to the bracket inside. Pulled the cover off and screws totally missing, fan and inside of heater looked as if it had been running with the fan hitting inside of housing. Screws not inside the heater nor in the box. Got the fan straightened out and bought screws from hardware store, remounted fan and turned the heater on. It started working and seemed to be okay. The heater coil is not suppose to turn red while it is running however on day 2 the coil is starting to turn red while heating so the coil is not going to last very long before it shorts out. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time to work on it to get it running. If I had just wanted a fan I could have bought several fans from Walmart for what this cost.', ""Using on construction site.  Keeps 3 bedroom townhouses at 70 degrees.Bought 15 open box and 1 new.  Could not tell the difference.  One heater had a loose fan bracket.Tightened screws and it was good.  Another heater had a fan that rattled. Had some play on the drive shaft.  Added a washer and it was good as new.  Can't complain because they were 1/2 the price of new ones.  Wish they had a different plug.

Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,73.29,281 sold,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!  More than pleased hubby here...........""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681),51.3,94 sold,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product? It really depends upon your application need. I put this in my truck due to no floor board heat. It does help but the heat is so so at best. The blow power is very minimal but it does help for my application']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Sengoku CTN-110 KeroHeat Portable Radiant Kerosene Space Heater, 10,000 BTU",184.98,20 sold,"[""I currently have a couple of these kerosene heaters and I like to rotate them out every so often, as to not let the wick from just one get all of the use over the winter season. I have never had any problem with this heater and I would never go thru a winter without a couple of them. I always try to have a back up to what I use the most of, so I won't be without one working, just in case. They put out excellent heat in my room size of 15' X 24'. Also great if the power ever was to go out for a while during cold times. When the heater is fired up and the mantle is all glowing without any flame going higher than the mantle, I notice very little kerosene smell. Mine have been a life saver over the years that I've owned them. Bruce; TN."", ""I was not happy when I first got this heater.  The flame adjustment was only usable when it is in the all the way up position.  It should start out high and then after it mellows out you adjust it down.  Also the fumes were terrible!  I could not use it indoors.  I had tried it 3 times and would have sent it back but as it was heavy and a large box I just didn't want the hassle.  I pulled it off the back porch last night for one last try.  It worked great!  I stood right over it and inhaled and no fumes at all!  I was using K1 kero at 4.99 a gallon for indoor use.  So...it could be when a heater is new it has to burn a few tanks to get to where it needs to be.

Dr. Heater 240 Volt 5600 Watt Garage Workshop Portable Industrial Space Heater,75.99,130 sold,"['This does all I need for taking the chill off our two bay shop at ""Coop\'s Miata"" in Maple Valley Washington.It is quiet and efficient. The only negative thing is the short chord and the odd plug. I had to make a 20 ft extension chord with adaptation for my shop 240 service. Ended up changing the plug on the heater chord as well.  Couldn\'t find a chord female plug for this style. Worked out that I ended up using the same mail plug I use for my Tig. Word of caution: use the right gauge wire and keep it less than 25 feet.', ""I purchased this heater in 01/2013 to replace a propane bottle heater.  It is much safer than propane and the fan circulates the heat.  I have been extremely happy with this heater as it has worked great to heat my insulated garage/shop during the cold N. IL winters.  I gave it four stars due to the fact that the fan motor uses sleeve bearings and not ball so any dirt that accumulates on the blades causes vibration and wear on the bearings.  It is important to keep the fan blades clean to reduce wear and extend the life.  I suggest cleaning every season.  I just completed cleaning blades and fan bearings and the heater works like new again.  Very easy to do with just a few screws to remove cover and fan  Don't get me wrong this is a great heater for the price.  I will look into the model 966 which has a heavier duty fan when this wears out. "", ""Don't get me wrong they put out heat... But not like people brag about on them... If your in a two bay garage it will take the chill out in roughly in a hour with the door closed. Lots of 220 power used in an hr. If you put it beside you when working on a car in the open it cycles off and on the heating element a lot as if room temperature has been reached. Cold hot cold hot.... Wasn't worth adding a 220 outlet. Says industrial use only on the warning label on top, exactly what industry would have been nice to know... Because  commercial mechanic work does not qualify...."", ""I spent almost a couple hours reading and researching several heaters to help for winter work in the garage. My final decision in this unit was the power of the fan. It was much stronger BLOWER MOTOR than many others. It is built tough/rugged like (old school box style construction). I figured with the amount of electricity this draws and the fan strength, I'd get e bit more bang for the buck. I was wrong... I've seen more impressive 110 models in the past over this. Unfortunate results for the amount of electricity you pour out. It also has a horrible cool draft off one corner. How does a heater blow a cool breeze with the hot? (Maybe the blower is to strong for the heating element?) Even standing in front of this unit, It was not impressive on the heat being generated. If you don't care about electricity and need to blow a little bit of heat a distance then I would suggest this unit for you.... everyone else, I suggest researching other units."", 'When I received this heater the box was in perfect shape, no signs of damage, but when I opened it and pulled the heater out the fan was laying in the bottom not attached to the bracket inside. Pulled the cover off and screws totally missing, fan and inside of heater looked as if it had been running with the fan hitting inside of housing. Screws not inside the heater nor in the box. Got the fan straightened out and bought screws from hardware store, remounted fan and turned the heater on. It started working and seemed to be okay. The heater coil is not suppose to turn red while it is running however on day 2 the coil is starting to turn red while heating so the coil is not going to last very long before it shorts out. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time to work on it to get it running. If I had just wanted a fan I could have bought several fans from Walmart for what this cost.', ""Using on construction site.  Keeps 3 bedroom townhouses at 70 degrees.Bought 15 open box and 1 new.  Could not tell the difference.  One heater had a loose fan bracket.Tightened screws and it was good.  Another heater had a fan that rattled. Had some play on the drive shaft.  Added a washer and it was good as new.  Can't complain because they were 1/2 the price of new ones.  Wish they had a different plug.  A dryer or range end would be better."", 'This is to backup the same model in use for a couple years, they work very well.

Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,73.29,281 sold,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681),51.3,94 sold,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product?

"Sengoku CTN-110 KeroHeat Portable Radiant Kerosene Space Heater, 10,000 BTU",184.98,20 sold,"[""I currently have a couple of these kerosene heaters and I like to rotate them out every so often, as to not let the wick from just one get all of the use over the winter season. I have never had any problem with this heater and I would never go thru a winter without a couple of them. I always try to have a back up to what I use the most of, so I won't be without one working, just in case. They put out excellent heat in my room size of 15' X 24'. Also great if the power ever was to go out for a while during cold times. When the heater is fired up and the mantle is all glowing without any flame going higher than the mantle, I notice very little kerosene smell. Mine have been a life saver over the years that I've owned them. Bruce; TN."", ""I was not happy when I first got this heater.  The flame adjustment was only usable when it is in the all the way up position.  It should start out high and then after it mellows out you adjust it down.  Also the fumes were terrible!  I could not use it indoors.  I had tried it 3 times and would have sent it back but as it was heavy and a large box I just didn't want the hassle.  I pulled it off the back porch last night for one last try.  It worked great!  I stood right over it and inhaled and no fumes at all!  I was using K1 kero at 4.99 a gallon for indoor use.  So...it could be when a heater is new it has to burn a few tanks to get to where it needs to be.  I am satisfied now but still wish the wick came up higher...but it is a good heater...you just have to burn it off a few times."", 'Work great no fumes and heats up a room with a tin roof and cement floor real good', 'Heater is amazing.

Dr. Heater 240 Volt 5600 Watt Garage Workshop Portable Industrial Space Heater,75.99,130 sold,"['This does all I need for taking the chill off our two bay shop at ""Coop\'s Miata"" in Maple Valley Washington.It is quiet and efficient. The only negative thing is the short chord and the odd plug. I had to make a 20 ft extension chord with adaptation for my shop 240 service. Ended up changing the plug on the heater chord as well.  Couldn\'t find a chord female plug for this style. Worked out that I ended up using the same mail plug I use for my Tig. Word of caution: use the right gauge wire and keep it less than 25 feet.', ""I purchased this heater in 01/2013 to replace a propane bottle heater.  It is much safer than propane and the fan circulates the heat.  I have been extremely happy with this heater as it has worked great to heat my insulated garage/shop during the cold N. IL winters.  I gave it four stars due to the fact that the fan motor uses sleeve bearings and not ball so any dirt that accumulates on the blades causes vibration and wear on the bearings.  It is important to keep the fan blades clean to reduce wear and extend the life.  I suggest cleaning every season.  I just completed cleaning blades and fan bearings and the heater works like new again.  Very easy to do with just a few screws to remove cover and fan  Don't get me wrong this is a great heater for the price.  I will look into the model 966 which has a heavier duty fan when this wears out. "", ""Don't get me wrong they put out heat... But not like people brag about on them... If your in a two bay garage it will take the chill out in roughly in a hour with the door closed. Lots of 220 power used in an hr. If you put it beside you when working on a car in the open it cycles off and on the heating element a lot as if room temperature has been reached. Cold hot cold hot.... Wasn't worth adding a 220 outlet. Says industrial use only on the warning label on top, exactly what industry would have been nice to know... Because  commercial mechanic work does not qualify...."", ""I spent almost a couple hours reading and researching several heaters to help for winter work in the garage. My final decision in this unit was the power of the fan. It was much stronger BLOWER MOTOR than many others. It is built tough/rugged like (old school box style construction). I figured with the amount of electricity this draws and the fan strength, I'd get e bit more bang for the buck. I was wrong... I've seen more impressive 110 models in the past over this. Unfortunate results for the amount of electricity you pour out. It also has a horrible cool draft off one corner. How does a heater blow a cool breeze with the hot? (Maybe the blower is to strong for the heating element?) Even standing in front of this unit, It was not impressive on the heat being generated. If you don't care about electricity and need to blow a little bit of heat a distance then I would suggest this unit for you.... everyone else, I suggest researching other units."", 'When I received this heater the box was in perfect shape, no signs of damage, but when I opened it and pulled the heater out the fan was laying in the bottom not attached to the bracket inside. Pulled the cover off and screws totally missing, fan and inside of heater looked as if it had been running with the fan hitting inside of housing. Screws not inside the heater nor in the box. Got the fan straightened out and bought screws from hardware store, remounted fan and turned the heater on. It started working and seemed to be okay. The heater coil is not suppose to turn red while it is running however on day 2 the coil is starting to turn red while heating so the coil is not going to last very long before it shorts out. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time to work on it to get it running. If I had just wanted a fan I could have bought several fans from Walmart for what this cost.', ""Using on construction site.  Keeps 3 bedroom townhouses at 70 degrees.Bought 15 open box and 1 new.  Could not tell the difference.  One heater had a loose fan bracket.Tightened screws and it was good.  Another heater had a fan that rattled. Had some play on the drive shaft.  Added a washer and it was good as new.  Can't complain because they were 1/2 the price of new ones.  Wish they had a different plug.  A dryer or range end would be better."", 'This is to backup the same model in use for a couple years, they work very well. Only complaint is new one has a high pitched fan motor whine when the unit is not under a heat load with just the fan running.  ', 'An excellent buy. Good strong heat for  an old 20 x 20 wood garage with a high peak ceiling, and no insulation in very cold weather. Had to change the 30 amp 220v electrical receptacle, but that was it. Leave it on the floor, and it will do a good job.', 'Dr Infrared heater will work in a 600 foot building if it is insulated and dry walled temp 40F outdoors will stay 70-75 indoors easy I have a Gas heater , and use the Dr heater with it when it is 20 outdoors and keep it 70 indoors the Dr heat will turn on and off my gas keeps going . the last to days I left the gas go all night when I get to the Shop I turn dr heat on and turn the gas off from 7am to 5 pm the temp never got under 75 , it was 32 outdoors and got to 48 outdoors and I can turn Dr heater up or down to regulate the shop temp .

Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,73.29,281 sold,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!  More than pleased hubby here...........""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681),51.3,94 sold,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product? It really depends upon your application need. I put this in my truck due to no floor board heat. It does help but the heat is so so at best.

"Sengoku CTN-110 KeroHeat Portable Radiant Kerosene Space Heater, 10,000 BTU",184.98,20 sold,"[""I currently have a couple of these kerosene heaters and I like to rotate them out every so often, as to not let the wick from just one get all of the use over the winter season. I have never had any problem with this heater and I would never go thru a winter without a couple of them. I always try to have a back up to what I use the most of, so I won't be without one working, just in case. They put out excellent heat in my room size of 15' X 24'. Also great if the power ever was to go out for a while during cold times.

Mine have been a life saver over the years that I've owned them. Bruce; TN."", ""I was not happy when I first got this heater.  The flame adjustment was only usable when it is in the all the way up position.  It should start out high and then after it mellows out you adjust it down.  Also the fumes were terrible!  I could not use it indoors.  I had tried it 3 times and would have sent it back but as it was heavy and a large box I just didn't want the hassle.  I pulled it off the back porch last night for one last try.  It worked great!  I stood right over it and inhaled and no fumes at all!  I was using K1 kero at 4.99 a gallon for indoor use.

Dr. Heater 240 Volt 5600 Watt Garage Workshop Portable Industrial Space Heater,75.99,130 sold,"['This does all I need for taking the chill off our two bay shop at ""Coop\'s Miata"" in Maple Valley Washington.It is quiet and efficient. The only negative thing is the short chord and the odd plug. I had to make a 20 ft extension chord with adaptation for my shop 240 service. Ended up changing the plug on the heater chord as well.  Couldn\'t find a chord female plug for this style. Worked out that I ended up using the same mail plug I use for my Tig. Word of caution: use the right gauge wire and keep it less than 25 feet.', ""I purchased this heater in 01/2013 to replace a propane bottle heater.  It is much safer than propane and the fan circulates the heat.  I have been extremely happy with this heater as it has worked great to heat my insulated garage/shop during the cold N. IL winters.  I gave it four stars due to the fact that the fan motor uses sleeve bearings and not ball so any dirt that accumulates on the blades causes vibration and wear on the bearings.  It is important to keep the fan blades clean to reduce wear and extend the life.  I suggest cleaning every season.  I just completed cleaning blades and fan bearings and the heater works like new again.  Very easy to do with just a few screws to remove cover and fan  Don't get me wrong this is a great heater for the price.  I will look into the model 966 which has a heavier duty fan when this wears out. "", ""Don't get me wrong they put out heat... But not like people brag about on them... If your in a two bay garage it will take the chill out in roughly in a hour with the door closed. Lots of 220 power used in an hr. If you put it beside you when working on a car in the open it cycles off and on the heating element a lot as if room temperature has been reached. Cold hot cold hot.... Wasn't worth adding a 220 outlet. Says industrial use only on the warning label on top, exactly what industry would have been nice to know... Because  commercial mechanic work does not qualify...."", ""I spent almost a couple hours reading and researching several heaters to help for winter work in the garage. My final decision in this unit was the power of the fan. It was much stronger BLOWER MOTOR than many others. It is built tough/rugged like (old school box style construction). I figured with the amount of electricity this draws and the fan strength, I'd get e bit more bang for the buck. I was wrong... I've seen more impressive 110 models in the past over this. Unfortunate results for the amount of electricity you pour out. It also has a horrible cool draft off one corner. How does a heater blow a cool breeze with the hot? (Maybe the blower is to strong for the heating element?) Even standing in front of this unit, It was not impressive on the heat being generated. If you don't care about electricity and need to blow a little bit of heat a distance then I would suggest this unit for you.... everyone else, I suggest researching other units."", 'When I received this heater the box was in perfect shape, no signs of damage, but when I opened it and pulled the heater out the fan was laying in the bottom not attached to the bracket inside. Pulled the cover off and screws totally missing, fan and inside of heater looked as if it had been running with the fan hitting inside of housing. Screws not inside the heater nor in the box. Got the fan straightened out and bought screws from hardware store, remounted fan and turned the heater on. It started working and seemed to be okay. The heater coil is not suppose to turn red while it is running however on day 2 the coil is starting to turn red while heating so the coil is not going to last very long before it shorts out. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time to work on it to get it running. If I had just wanted a fan I could have bought several fans from Walmart for what this cost.', ""Using on construction site.  Keeps 3 bedroom townhouses at 70 degrees.Bought 15 open box and 1 new.  Could not tell the difference.  One heater had a loose fan bracket.Tightened screws and it was good.  Another heater had a fan that rattled. Had some play on the drive shaft.  Added a washer and it was good as new.  Can't complain because they were 1/2 the price of new ones.  Wish they had a different plug.  A dryer or range end would be better."", 'This is to backup the same model in use for a couple years, they work very well. Only complaint is new one has a high pitched fan motor whine when the unit is not under a heat load with just the fan running.  ', 'An excellent buy. Good strong heat for  an old 20 x 20 wood garage with a high peak ceiling, and no insulation in very cold weather. Had to change the 30 amp 220v electrical receptacle, but that was it. Leave it on the floor, and it will do a good job.', 'Dr Infrared heater will work in a 600 foot building if it is insulated and dry walled temp 40F outdoors will stay 70-75 indoors easy I have a Gas heater , and use the Dr heater with it when it is 20 outdoors and keep it 70 indoors the Dr heat will turn on and off my gas keeps going . the last to days I left the gas go all night when I get to the Shop I turn dr heat on and turn the gas off from 7am to 5 pm the temp never got under 75 , it was 32 outdoors and got to 48 outdoors and I can turn Dr heater up or down to regulate the shop temp . Only had Dr heater 10 days . Its been a lot of help so far .', ""Good heater at a good price.  Bought this one to replace the same heater I've had for a couple of years.  Only complaint I have is that this heater does not come with a parts list for ordering replacement parts.  My previous heater had the control (rheostat?) go bad, and I couldn't find what part I needed to replace it.""]","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).
