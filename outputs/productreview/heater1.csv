The Evoheat 270 is a well designed unit with great technology and a thoughtful accessible control panel. The installation went smoothly and the unit was up and running within minutes. Hot water within an hour. the inbuilt timer allows us to take best advantage of our solar power along with peak temperature control and vacation mode. Very happy so far after a week and a half- all running smoothly. Same Day Hot Water in Sydney were very helpful and informative about the product and installation options.', 'Extremely happy with the service by provider on Good Friday.  Came to my property within 2 hours of calling them.  They installed an Evo270.  It has only been a few so far but it has proven to give excellent hot water and much better water flow to areas where I need it.', 'Very happy with the information provided by Evoheat on there product. The plumber and the electrician that did the installation did a fantastic job. Very happy with the different modes available for when family and friends visit, as well as the low running cost for the average day to day operation.GJP', 'I replaced my instant gas hot water heater with an EVO270 to take advantage of a solar system I recently put on.  I chose EVO primarily due to the smaller footprint than some of the other heat pump units as space was tight as well as its good reviews.  The installation by John at Oxy Plumbing in Canberra went really smoothly, the unit it working well and seems very well built.', ""Very impressed with the unit and the installation was better than expected. The plumber was prompt and efficient and the  electrician completed the installation without a hitch. Overall extremely happy from the first phone call to the clean up after the unit was installed. Couldn't recommend both the unit and the installers highly enough"", ""I had my EVO270 installed today. It is as loud as my air-conditioning units and can be heard from my kitchen. But, it occurs during the day so there are minimal disruptions. If you write a review for Evo's you also get an extended warranty of 2 years. Thus this review."", ""Haven't had visitors so hopefully the unit will do the job for high demand! It copes well with our family of 3 and quiet.

The $1000 rebate was easy too.', ""We recently replaced an old gas instant hot water system with the EVO270-1. Hotter water, better pressure and minimal running cost, should have done it much sooner. We have it set to run in efficiency mode (compressor only) at most 3 hours per day and that's been sufficient in Melbourne for two adults and a teenager who has long hot showers - so far it has not run more than 2 hours on any day. Great product and highly recommended!"", 'Just installed today. so far so good. Sound very quite. Water hot and flow okay.I am interesting to see my electricity bill and I also like to know how setup this unit optimal with my solar panels system', 'Recently installed, very quick and efficient to use. Many options available to suit our needs for visitors and vacation times. Display is easy to use and change settings for different uses', 'Would recommend', 'We replaced our faithful gas hot water system with this. It appears really well made and very well thought through. It is quiet and clearly very energy efficient. It is quite large relative to its water capacity, but all of that is vertical as the compressor is mounted on top. Evoheat were very helpful in finding and selecting an installer, Blacktown Hotwater, who were terrific. It is a major investment, but the long term cost and the environmental impact are attractive. We have solar PV panels, so look forward to virtually free hot water without the hassle of installing rooftop plumbing.', 'Modern, quiet, lots of features and extremely efficient.

The energy efficiency and 6 year warranty were important factors in my decision. Very nice unit!', 'In Jan 22 we installed a Reclaim Energy - REHP-CO2-315GL (TANK SIZE: 323L). No issues initially; however, the system has developed a water hammer problem. When taps are shut off quickly, I can feel the hammering in the reservoir. Is there something that can be done to prevent this, apart from lowering out water pressure or installing an arrestor. Thanks', 'Hello Paul, this is rather an installation issue not a product issue matter. I would suggest you to bring on your plumber and ask them to check the maximum pressure on cold inlet with a limiting valve...', 'Re the REHP-CO2-315GL, the electricity for heating the water is 0.87 kW electricity in for 5.24 kW heat to the water at COP conditions.   What is it that may cause the unit to draw 2.3 kW as per the specifications please?.', 'Hello Peter, Thanks for the question here. The heat pump power draw is variable based on ambient and water temperatures. The rated value is 0.8-1.1 kW during all year round and 2.3 kW only may occur i...', 'We live in Canberra where the winter temperature drops anywhere from -2 to -5 degrees at night. Will the Reclaim unit freeze up and create a lot of noise when it is trying to re-heat. The unit will be located down the side of the house where it never gets any sunshine. Our bedroom windows are only a meter away. How noisy is the unit when it ‘thaws’? Also, our neighbours windows are only 2 meters away and we would hate a neighbourhood dispute because of noise.I am asking this question because we have reverse cycle heating and the outside unit makes a terrible noise in winter when it’s trying to ‘thaw’.  At the time we were assured by the installer that the unit “will not be noisy”….he lied. Hence my question re noise with the Reclaim unit. thanks in advance.

EcoAlliance Dynaheat,3.4,"['There is not a single pipe clip on the copper piping which is just running through mid air....', 'have not had any issues with this system. It is a replacement one and the changeover was smooth. The men were on time and took minimum time to take the old one and put in the new service. Gave information about how long for the water to heat etc.', 'The sales team were helpful and installation was quick and easy. The unit performs well with up to 4 people at home. The unit is quiet and will provide lower power usage going forward. Hopefully it will last around 10 to 15 years like your normal electric HWS. Thanks for a good product.', 'A few months after a poor sales experience with Eco Alliance I revisited upgrading our HWS. I found the sales team performance had changed considerably for the better. The lack of information available regarding system size for a household of 2, with occasional guests made the decision to replace my 315L electric HWS difficult. We decided to install the new Eco Alliance Dynaheat 215L unit. The issue of having enough hot water for two is still of concern. Two 5 min showers leave little hot water, the upside being, within an hour we have hot wate...', ""Thanks for leaving the review Ian! Feel free to reach out to us again regarding the size, if you haven't already, we may be able to offer a potential solution."", 'Installation was fair given that I had to call back for plumbing to be fixed as it was not pressure tested on Installation and had multiple leaks. Difficult getting response from Service Department without making multiple calls. Overall satisfaction 8 out of 10.', 'Thanks for leaving the review John. Sorry to hear it took so long to get it fixed, but glad we got there in the end!', 'Applied for hot water service and it was installed in 2weeks. Fitters did an excellent job, very helpful and polite. Works fine, plenty of hot water and not noisy. Overall, very happy. Thank you', 'Lovely to hear that Val, thanks for the review!', 'So far temperature is constant no fluctuations while in use but have not had the chance to use shower dishwasher and washing machine at the same time to see how it will cope', 'Thanks for leaving the review Bulla!', 'We have not run out of hot water since having our new hot water system installed.It is economical,efficient,quiet and the water temperature is consistent. Highly recommend the Dynaheat 215 lt. system.', 'Thanks for leaving the review Gayle!', 'Dealing with Eco Alliance has been a pleasure. The staff on the phone were courteous and helpful. Even when l had difficulty with taking the necessary photos of my old system Lol.When the service men came to install the new system, they left no mess behind and  completed the job in no time .The new system works well .Hot water always on tap !!!Thanks to all of you at Eco Alliance. We are extremely happy!!Would recommend !!!', ""Thanks Serena! We've recently been working on our customer experience from start to finish, and I'm really glad you've had a great one!

We appreciate it, and we want to make use of the government rebates for as many people as possible while they last too!', 'We have been totally overwhelmed with the efficiency of the unit. We have had no issues with pressure, even while using more than one tap at a time. The temperature has always been at the required level for our satisfaction.', ""Thanks Paul. Glad everything's going well for you. Please let us know if you need anything further in the future."", '1.  Overall, the unit is very satisfactory and hopefully much more efficient than my old 30+ year old (internal) electric hot water system2.  The unit is more bulky than other units on the market, as the water storage tank and the heat-pump are separate units and take up quite a bit of ground space (some competitors have the tank and heat pump incorporated into one free-standing unit)3.  The unit needed to be adjusted to increase the flow of hot water - this was a simple procedure and carefully explained by a technician on the phone4.  The unit is very quiet', 'Thanks for your honest review Richard. We appreciate you taking the time to leave it.', 'Unit copes well water is always hot we are very happy with the unit. The unit is very quiet and we will be waiting to see the difference in the power bill since installation', ""Thanks Rick! Hopefully goes exactly to plan regarding the energy costs, but if it doesn't please give us a call - always happy to help. Cheers"", 'Our unit works perfectly to suit our different needs. There are no fluctuations ever in the temperature.

I look forward to your reply. Thank you Carol Whittle.', 'Hi Carol - The heat pump fan will run when the tank temperature drops below a certain temperature, to bring it back on. The heat pumps do not use on/off peak as they are already 70% more efficient in their power usage.', 'this may be a silly question but how do you adjust the clock time at the heat pump eco alliance hws', 'Hi Frank, please see the video featured here.
