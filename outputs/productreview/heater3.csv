We’d consider another brand next time around but would probably face the same issue. We have a long flue so it draws fine.

It heats soo well, and only minor issues, 1 was a gas cock which was easy to self diagnose and replace, the other a flue fan annoyance. In 14 years this is certainly to be expected. the Heater works with the wireless remote and having the program function allows us to get up to a warm house without heating the place all night. I would definitely buy again', 'After putting up with a wood fire heater for the past 13 years, We decided to buy a gas log fire heater.As our house is open planned we needed something with a bit of grunt, to heat the place up, so we opted to buy the IS900 heater. The difference it made to warming the house was unbelievable. We had to install a ceiling fan upstairs to recirculate the heat downstairs, as it was getting a bit too hot upstairs, but that was a minor issue.However after one year, we did have a minor issue with the flue fan, and rang Archer to see if they could s...', 'Purchased this heater & was installed in January, no reason to use it until the weather got cold. Biggest piece of rubbish ever, won’t stay alight, flame it does go dance’s all over the place then turns itself off. To say that I disappointed is an understatement. What’s more no one seems to care. I have rung about it but to no avail!', 'One just needs to rectify the install and all will work well..........', 'It was installed by the recommended installer.', 'it is still installed incorrectly and will not function correctly until the install is rectified regardless of who installed it we as a manufacturer do not recommend any installers it should be simply...', ""Our house is lovely and warm. It doesn't take long for the room to heat up. So cozy having the heater on while watching TV. We did have some issues initially with the heater turning itself on and off unexpectedly but the technician worked out it was an installation issue. The problem has now been rectified . The heater itself was never faulty. Now everything is working perfectly. Very glad we purchased an Archer gas heater."", 'I am so happy with my gas heater and from the start to the follow up I received in conversations with the girls that run the office was amazing.Many times I have spoken to Lee who might as well run the whole company. Her knowledge and professionalism is exemplary. Nothing is a bother or a problem to Lee. I lost my manual for my heater and straight away Lee said she would send one out.Lee has got a great personality and sense of humour that I have found when having phone conversations with her.Thank you Lee right from the first phone call s...', 'What is the cost for a remote thermostat for a series 900 gas heater........', 'The cost is $329.00', 'Hi, we have an Archer gas log fire heater which is 15 years old. We have never had an issue as we use it very rarely at our holiday home.The problem we have is that the back burner will not light up. We have changed the batteries both in the remote and the heater.  The front burner comes on and the fan but not the back.Could you please advise what needs to be done to rectify the problem.RegardsToni Russo', ""Our Archer heater this morning will not ignite.  You turn it on, the ignition leds flash for a bit and the fan is on but it simply won't ignite the gas.  The gas is working fine elsewhere in the house.

Kent Calisto,2.7,"['Just purchased this heater in the medium size. We looked around and in our opinion was the best value for money as others where double the price. Heats up well!', 'This is the small model and it suits our room perfectly. It did take me a week to learn how to get the best output as we have never had a wood heater. It is very efficient and will slow burn for hours if you learn to use the vent control. We luv this heater.', 'This is a great heater.  New Calisto small model has rubber on the Door handle that stops it from heating up. Heats room really well and looks amazing.  We just love it.', ""Burns through a lot more wood than old heater but struggles to heat living room. Door handle jams - almost from start. Fan is noisy like old AC in a cheap motel.  Brochure says proudly 'Made for Australia' but made in China."", 'Nearly didn’t buy the Calisto large because of the negative reviews. Had it for a week and very pleased with its heating capacity. We have a large area and it heats well. Sure the handles get very hot but we use gloves with the wood so no problem.', ""We installed this fairlight heater while renovating an old open fire. We paid the extra money to purchase a kent as they were ment to be a reputable brand.We are extremely disappointed with this heater. The fans are not sized correctly and are always on hight too try and warm our small living area. We hoped that it would heat our house but we still need to leave our electric heater on so we dont freeze. This is our third place with a wood heater and this is by far the worst heater we have had . If I had my time again I wouldn't even look at the range. Saying all that they do look good if that's what your after."", 'I recently installed the new Kent Callisto medium size fire and to say I’m disappointed is an understatement. The fire is noisy constantly whistling the handles are untouchable when you try to restock the fire if it’s been lit previously.Also the heat output you claim that it heats up to 300sq meters is absolutely not even close even with the fan on you cannot feel any heat the fire itself gets really hot but unless you are standing next to the fire you can’t feel the heat and the fan is absolutely useless as it doesn’t push any heat out. I have emailed customer services twice with no reply and tried to leave a review on there site but was blocked from doing so.', 'We replaced our old Kent wood fire with a Calisto Medium sized one. We find it heats up our space nicely. We are getting a little older now so we chose it because of the wood storage area. The only thing is the handle gets a little hot but we just use a glove. We could be happier with it.', 'Our experience is exactly the same is the previous one.Heater itself become scolding hot. Fan is useless and if you are not directly on top of the heater you are cold.The manufacturer tried to blame every part of our home, wood, flu, roof height and so on as a reason why it wouldn’t heat our home.Outcome- they are refunding the heater. Yep it looks good but is hopeless.Don’t buy one.', ""To put bluntly I wished I kept my old 37 year old wood heater. Yes it looks good but that is where it stops! Makes a huge mess, coals constantly fall out, ash is always built up on the window and yes I'm using jarrah wood. It doesn't pump out any heat. The handle is way too hot to touch, I have more burns in my carpet from the last 3 months than I have had in the last 25 years!. This fireplace is hazardous, useless and poorly designed. Funnily enough I could not put a review on the Kent website!!"", 'Brought this wood fire mainly because we wanted a modern design, and it does look great. Unfortunately that’s where the praises stop. It’s heating ability is terrible. We wanted one with a fan to help push the air around, however when the fan is on the highest setting you can’t feel it even when you’re directly in front of it. The door and air handles also get so hot you need a towel or glove to open them. Very cheaply made. Would not recommend. We will have to waste more money now and buy a different one or freeze. Tried to leave review on Kent’s page, but they don’t accept bad feedback apparently.', 'We are having a terrible smell coming from the fire/flue the fire has been burned about a dozen times the smell is so bad we have to shut it down and open the house to get rid of the smell. The fire been burned for a long period of time so it should not just be new smell we are at a loss as too the reason for the smell', ""We had a   strong chemical smell when rhe fire was burning as the flue was painted on the outside,  this went after 3 or 4 days. It's fine now so I think you should contact the manufacturers."", 'Thank you, yes it is a chemical smell, very bad. Company has been and replaced the outer Flue but still the same !!!We have purchased fireplaces before over a 30yr period and never experienced anything like this.', 'Had the same problem Leigh - went on for months. Strong toxic smell, gave me a bad headache. Overall impression is this is a dodgy made in China product - possibly dangerous. New issue with door handl...', 'Can someone tell me where the air flow handles should be pointed to be fully open or low as there are no markings to show positions', 'Fully open is when the handle is fully extended. Hope that helps.', 'We have a Kent Evolution 8 wood heater and it just will not heat up, it has a fan that that will not blow any air, it is a failure, burns plenty of wood but we think that all of the heat goes up the chimney because nothing hap0ens in the house.Has anybody else had this problem with Kent ?', '©\xa02022 ProductReview.com.au Pty.
