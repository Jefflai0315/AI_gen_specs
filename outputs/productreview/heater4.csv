I will reach out to your directly to get some further information. Thanks"", ""Don't throw the heater out. There are solutions,There are hundreds of complaints regarding the Lcd timer, it is obvious a design fault and Nobo will certainly not admit to it on an online forum, thats why they keep saying contact our technical department, who in my opinion are not technically adept. Rather than pay $170 for a replacement timer ( which Nobo should supply for free) the simple solution is take the front panel off, and pull the 4 pin plug which connects the timer to the main board.

Granted we purchased in 2010,  However I wanted something that would offer a nice radiant heat throughout the space.  I didn't want the unit with a timer, however the store had no other model.  Big mistake.  It has been in for repair just about every year after purchase, usually at the start of winter, it works for a bit then breaks down.  I believe most issues are around the timer/thermostat.  I did ask the repairers last time if we can get rid of the timer, however they did not offer much help apart from that they just replace the part.

This heater is designed with timer to be left on for extended periods and keep the room at a certain temperature, which it does really well.  I don't know how efficient it is, but if you room is well sealed the heater will likely not have to work too hard to keep it at your desired heat and not be super expensive.

Now the bricks are stupidly fragile  so when i complained was told to place logs in gently are you serious how do you place a lo...', 'Most expensive and worst fireplace I have ever had. Smoke fills the room when you try to add wood and even comes through the glass when you turn down the baffle. Not enough room in the bottom to catch ash makes you have to empty it weekly. Fire bricks have already cracked. Do not waste your money', ""This is the worst log burner we've had.  It's been riddled with faults from the start, including paint framing on glass coming off, glass migrating sideways and breaking, and firebricks not lasting a couple of seasons even under careful and correct usage.  I will never buy a Stovax product again."", 'Where to start, well they say you should always start with a positive it looks fantastic, but sorry to say it is all down hill from there like other reviews I have read we also are having trouble with the bricks falling and breaking, it burns way too hot even when it is turned down, now the glass has migrated side ways and have been told it was because we did not do a 12 month maintenance check um we have not had it twelve months ha go figure. It smokes on lighting and also when you put more wood on, running gag in house get wood in before smoke detector goes off.', ""I installed a STOVAX Riva Studio 3 (built-in with fans) in my own house in 2014.  If I knew how bad the product was and the amount of problems and costs in fixing it, I would have stayed far, far away from STOVAX.  The outer heater box wasn't even painted so you looked at a tin zinc box with a heater sitting in it.  The extra work involved in setting up the correct materials around the fireplace is over the top compared to other bands/models of a comparative built-in heater (the STOVAX doesn't put out the heat to warrant this work). These costs..."", 'I have had the Riva 2 inbuilt for 3 years now and very happy with it. Bought it from Subiaco Restoration very helpful people. We had a fire box but wanted a more modern look. We looked around for a built-in unit as we wanted a cladded wall look but they were chunky and did not have a clean look about them until we found the Stovax Webb site and did some research and bought one. I did the framing myself and used a product called Supa Board from Choice Building Products which is fire resistant cladded to a steel frame.

Constantly looking like when it is burning there is a blockage in the flue somewhere yet it is brand new and flue is clear. Have lived in the hills my whole life and know how to light and keep a fire running. When opening door smoke pours out and fills the room with smoke setting off fire alarm. Terribly disappointed.', ""We've had this Studio 2 for many years now, and mostly loved it. It looks great and suits our house.Had a small issue with the door mechanism that I had to repair and had to replace the fire bricks, couldn't come at the price for Stovax parts so replaced with the same material sourced elsewhere and custom fitted.The clincher maybe, we have to replace the Baffle parts as they've rusted out, and supply in Australia by our local dealer was originally quoted as around twice that than the currency exchange from England. Castworks did better, but..."", 'This fireplace is beautiful to look at and was the most modern looking fireplace on the market at the time of purchase. We have had it in for 2 seasons now. Ours is with the zero frame and we tiled to this edge on advice from the installer that fire cement sheet is prone to cracking around the fire.  The fire is lovely and warm even without any fan and we run it most days over winter.  Once the fire is running and the door is closed the fire burns well and there is little smoke expelling from the chimney which is in keeping with being a good ne...', 'We have found that burning the kindling with ...', 'We are thrilled with our purchase of the Stovax 3.  The heat that is generated without a fan is incredible, it is heating a 100 sqm area with ease.  Visually the unit looks incredible, it is a real feature in the room.  Very easy to clean and makes the cold winter days/evenings cosy.  Absolutely no regrets !!!!!  LOVE IT, would recommend to anyone !!!!!', 'Has there been any changes to Stovax Studio 3 freestanding in the last few years? there seems to be lots of negative feedback but they a nice to look at and am hesitant to get one if the current model still has problems', 'Mine was only installed in 2019 and it has a lot of problems, as mentioned in my original review.  I was told they have now discontinued the Studio 3, but that may be only in Australia.  There has to ...', ""I have a stovax studio 2 that I bought in 2013. Had a heap of problems, mainly with cracking plasterboard around the zero clearance. Turns out the installer that I was recommended by the vendor thought it a good idea to line the cavity with fibre cement sheeting - including the base so no ventilation. So fixed that (my cost) now have the highest heat rated board in aus installed (my cost), still cracking and gets hotter than hell. Yes, it smokes like a bastard sometimes, particularly when it's a still night. No, the dampener doesn't change the burn rate. Yes, the glass get's dirty quick, particularly on the hinge side, and sometimes on lighting it looks like a smoke waterfall rolling around in there - But i love it. Maybe Stockholm syndrome? Anyhoo, have been veeery gentle with it and managed it through till now. But now it needs a service - how/who/what do i need to get that done? And how much? I suspect it needs new bricks, rope etc. Cannot be assed doing it myself - I'd probably stuff it up and I need someone to warranty the work. But I wonder, like those who don't go to the dentist because they think the plaque is the only thing holding their amalgam fillings in place, am I asking for trouble?"", 'I have a Studio 3 - same problems.  I finally got fed up with its many design faults and am taking it out, to replace it with a gas fire.', 'Hi I have a stovax studio 2 wood fire installed in our new build. It has only been lit this winter and the glass cleans very well except for one patch in the middle of the glass that is dull/cloudy all the time except when I wet it to clean it,but as it dries the cloudy patch reappears.  I would like a recommendation on what to clean it with as it really detracts from a beautiful effective fire,I have a photo I could send to someone if that assists?Regards Michelle', ""Hi Michelle - I have found metholated spririts dipped in the burnt ashes cleans very well.
