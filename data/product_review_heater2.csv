Very happy so far after a week and a half- all running smoothly. Same Day Hot Water in Sydney were very helpful and informative about the product and installation options.', 'Extremely happy with the service by provider on Good Friday.  Came to my property within 2 hours of calling them.  They installed an Evo270.  It has only been a few so far but it has proven to give excellent hot water and much better water flow to areas where I need it.', 'Very happy with the information provided by Evoheat on there product. The plumber and the electrician that did the installation did a fantastic job. Very happy with the different modes available for when family and friends visit, as well as the low running cost for the average day to day operation.GJP', 'I replaced my instant gas hot water heater with an EVO270 to take advantage of a solar system I recently put on.  I chose EVO primarily due to the smaller footprint than some of the other heat pump units as space was tight as well as its good reviews.  The installation by John at Oxy Plumbing in Canberra went really smoothly, the unit it working well and seems very well built.', ""Very impressed with the unit and the installation was better than expected. The plumber was prompt and efficient and the  electrician completed the installation without a hitch. Overall extremely happy from the first phone call to the clean up after the unit was installed. Couldn't recommend both the unit and the installers highly enough"", ""I had my EVO270 installed today. It is as loud as my air-conditioning units and can be heard from my kitchen. But, it occurs during the day so there are minimal disruptions. If you write a review for Evo's you also get an extended warranty of 2 years. Thus this review."", ""Haven't had visitors so hopefully the unit will do the job for high demand! It copes well with our family of 3 and quiet.

We have it set to run in efficiency mode (compressor only) at most 3 hours per day and that's been sufficient in Melbourne for two adults and a teenager who has long hot showers - so far it has not run more than 2 hours on any day. Great product and highly recommended!"", 'Just installed today. so far so good. Sound very quite. Water hot and flow okay.I am interesting to see my electricity bill and I also like to know how setup this unit optimal with my solar panels system', 'Recently installed, very quick and efficient to use. Many options available to suit our needs for visitors and vacation times. Display is easy to use and change settings for different uses', 'Would recommend', 'We replaced our faithful gas hot water system with this. It appears really well made and very well thought through. It is quiet and clearly very energy efficient. It is quite large relative to its water capacity, but all of that is vertical as the compressor is mounted on top. Evoheat were very helpful in finding and selecting an installer, Blacktown Hotwater, who were terrific. It is a major investment, but the long term cost and the environmental impact are attractive. We have solar PV panels, so look forward to virtually free hot water without the hassle of installing rooftop plumbing.', 'Modern, quiet, lots of features and extremely efficient.

Saxon Blackwood SXBW07K,3.1,"[""Heater was installed in the house when we moved in. I would have fitted a gas heater, but have enjoyed the wood heater. Generates warmth well and keeps the house warm for longer than central heating. The vent mechanism keeps on getting stuck and as it is on top of the stove no oil/silicone remains, it just burns off. Only issue compared to equivalent branded Coonara's I've used is the smoke always that enters the house when topping the wood up - it's almost as if the front overhang is too short. Ensuring the vent is open and fan is off makes no difference to the smoke escaping. Our chimney is over 3m tall so it has more than enough draft."", ""Don't waste your money on one of these pieces of crap! For a start the 20 minute timer on the fan will drive you insane. If you don't know what I'm talking about,  it basically means that if you open the door the fan won't come back on for 20 minutes.  Secondly they have very poor air draw, even with the vent open they still go out. Thirdly on the off chance you overcome those issues the fan is so loud you'll think you're living next-door to an airport. Please take my advice and don't waste your time or money."", 'when we bought the heater we had problems with the automatic fan not working.We then were able to by pass this.Our next issue is the fire is very smokey every time we open the door smoke fills the house, I was told to make sure the flue is clean but cant unable to remove the baffle plate to clean the flue', ""I'm so happy with my Saxon heater,. the old one chewed up wood without giving out heat, this one warms my lounge area and takes the chill off the rest of the house.Took a while to sort the fan out but with help from Bbques galore it was fine."", 'Just spent $ 3000 on the Saxon Blackwood heater. The design is nice, and i love not dealing with broken heater bricks as there are none.The fan is supposed to switch on after 20 minutes, gets switched off each time the door is opened. How inconvenient. We complained as our fan was not working at all.BBQ galore sent somebody out who removed the front plate under the door (remove the 2 screws on each side), There, inside on the right side, is a switch you can press to turn that silly 20 minute delay feature off.Can’t wait to use the oven tonight for the first time!!!I keep the one star rating for the disgusting service at BBQ Galore Maroochydore where the staff treated us like idiots, causing us a lot of distress.', '""Our heaters are all designed and tested in Australia from components sourced from countries such as Denmark, Germany & USA. We then use contracted factories to assembly them"" There are the clues I missed. These heaters are made in China, not Australia as I assumed. I wanted to support Australia but was deceived by Saxon. If they are unethical in their marketing how else might they deal with me? I feel burnt. Buy Coonara for a little bit more which matters little at these prices.', ""Made in Tasmania, quality built firebox 8mm thick, baffle in mine is also 8mm thick as it was manufactured 2013. My house is over 20 square meters with 3 large living areas and the saxon heats the entire house. Fan quality is average at best as the original 1 packed up within first 3 years. This model has 3 speed settings and no time delay. Only thing I would do is put the magnets in as others have said in post here and elsewhere. Mine is run for a good 6 months of the year so they are well made. I would give it 5 stars but the fan let's it down."", ""We purchased & installed the unit just in June 2018. From day 1 it was a dude but neither the supplier nor manufacturer would do anything. In fact to this day we have never heard back from the manufacturer. To get a reasonable level of heat out of it we now need to have the fan on high. This means you then have to turn the TV to a very high level to hear it over the fan, conversation is nigh on impossible.I don't think I have ever been so disappointed with a product.All I can say is don't buy one & if your still thinking of buying one DON'T."", 'We bought our Saxon Blackwood built in heater in April 2020.

Anyway the fan, when it finally turns on, is ridiculously loud even on low! and the safety feature that prevents the vent from closing so you can do slow burn means it chews through a ton of wood and never burns all night but I'm told all new fireplaces are the same (vent wise) these days as it's all about safety"", 'At first i was pretty dissapointed especially with the 20 minute fan delay. After making the adjustment to overide the fan delay, so i can have fan on and off constantly at my discretion, things changed. The rooms heat up much quicker and the magnets, which i settled to cover 4 of the 12mm holes in the slide vent, enables a slower burn.

I know for a fact it doesn't use 2400W all the time as I monitor our energy usage on our Solar energy consumption app. That is, sometimes it only uses 1000W, and only goes up to 2400W when the room is really cold and the heater is just starting up. I suppose this automatic variable heating is how Noirot can be economical. Love the lifetime warranty too."", ""We have a few different sizes of the Noirot Spot Plus. This 1000W is for our kid's room. We decided to pay the extra $40 to get the one with timer, not so much for the timer itself, but for the LCD screen which allows us to set the exact temperature. This is simple to use. No need to worry about different heat settings. Just set the desired temperature, and the thing does its work."", 'Can’t believe how good this is! Heats our entire 2 bedroom apartment up and keeps it warm. The timer lets us set it up for mornings & evenings - would recommend to anyone with a small house', 'Well we have just moved into a new village retirement home  and was looking for a heater that if used properly give us quality and service  we went for this heater. We have a small computer room and a small tv room which does get cold besides it was just used to take the chill out of the room we already have a large heat pump that is enough to cover open plan of this house my sister in law has had one for 5 to 6 years and has not had a problem I will be buying a s cond one', ""- Absolutely no noise due to the monobloc heating element.  No expanding/contracting crack/noise.- Easy to use.  Haven't yet used the timer setting due to the fact that it was easy enough to turn on and wait for a bit for the room to heat up.  Room is about 10m2 so it is pretty quick to heat up.- Very happy with the purchase"", 'Not happy sadly.  I feel the Nobo which I had before beats it hands down.  Why I did not purchase another Nobo beats me. Have to turn reverse cycle on to boost the heat. Not feel it heats as well as Nobo. We have blocked kitchen and small hallway off with curtains to keep heat in lounge', 'Does a very good job of heating, no noise just hot. I would certainly buy one again, had it for a couple of years now and it does get a work out.', 'Heats room quickly and effectively  Previously any heater I tried irritated my eyes.  Only negative is that it is very hot to touch so not suitable if you have toddlers,although it can be mounted on the wall.', 'This is the perfect wall heater for our apartment living room. It works quickly and efficiently with zero noise. We also have vented heating/cooling aircon. We use the Noirot to supplement the aircon during the depths of winter.
