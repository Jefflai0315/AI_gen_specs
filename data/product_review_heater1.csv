EvoHeat EVO270,4.8,"['We recently had to replace our original heat pump hot water after 25 years. The Evoheat 270 is a well designed unit with great technology and a thoughtful accessible control panel. The installation went smoothly and the unit was up and running within minutes. Hot water within an hour. the inbuilt timer allows us to take best advantage of our solar power along with peak temperature control and vacation mode. Very happy so far after a week and a half- all running smoothly. Same Day Hot Water in Sydney were very helpful and informative about the product and installation options.', 'Extremely happy with the service by provider on Good Friday.  Came to my property within 2 hours of calling them.  They installed an Evo270.  It has only been a few so far but it has proven to give excellent hot water and much better water flow to areas where I need it.', 'Very happy with the information provided by Evoheat on there product. The plumber and the electrician that did the installation did a fantastic job. Very happy with the different modes available for when family and friends visit, as well as the low running cost for the average day to day operation.GJP', 'I replaced my instant gas hot water heater with an EVO270 to take advantage of a solar system I recently put on.  I chose EVO primarily due to the smaller footprint than some of the other heat pump units as space was tight as well as its good reviews.  The installation by John at Oxy Plumbing in Canberra went really smoothly, the unit it working well and seems very well built.', ""Very impressed with the unit and the installation was better than expected. The plumber was prompt and efficient and the  electrician completed the installation without a hitch. Overall extremely happy from the first phone call to the clean up after the unit was installed. Couldn't recommend both the unit and the installers highly enough"", ""I had my EVO270 installed today. It is as loud as my air-conditioning units and can be heard from my kitchen. But, it occurs during the day so there are minimal disruptions. If you write a review for Evo's you also get an extended warranty of 2 years. Thus this review."", ""Haven't had visitors so hopefully the unit will do the job for high demand! It copes well with our family of 3 and quiet. Very happy with the purchase so far"", 'Unit has greatly reduced my energy costs and electricity bills.To be  honest had an issue just after 12 months but EVO service were prompt and great regarding getting it all fixed.', 'Very happy with this purchase, arrived on time and easy sale process. We have 4 humans in our house so have future proofed for when they are all big water guzzling teens. The $1000 rebate was easy too.', ""We recently replaced an old gas instant hot water system with the EVO270-1. Hotter water, better pressure and minimal running cost, should have done it much sooner. We have it set to run in efficiency mode (compressor only) at most 3 hours per day and that's been sufficient in Melbourne for two adults and a teenager who has long hot showers - so far it has not run more than 2 hours on any day. Great product and highly recommended!"", 'Just installed today. so far so good. Sound very quite. Water hot and flow okay.I am interesting to see my electricity bill and I also like to know how setup this unit optimal with my solar panels system', 'Recently installed, very quick and efficient to use. Many options available to suit our needs for visitors and vacation times. Display is easy to use and change settings for different uses', 'Would recommend', 'We replaced our faithful gas hot water system with this. It appears really well made and very well thought through. It is quiet and clearly very energy efficient. It is quite large relative to its water capacity, but all of that is vertical as the compressor is mounted on top. Evoheat were very helpful in finding and selecting an installer, Blacktown Hotwater, who were terrific. It is a major investment, but the long term cost and the environmental impact are attractive. We have solar PV panels, so look forward to virtually free hot water without the hassle of installing rooftop plumbing.', 'Modern, quiet, lots of features and extremely efficient.

Generates warmth well and keeps the house warm for longer than central heating. The vent mechanism keeps on getting stuck and as it is on top of the stove no oil/silicone remains, it just burns off. Only issue compared to equivalent branded Coonara's I've used is the smoke always that enters the house when topping the wood up - it's almost as if the front overhang is too short. Ensuring the vent is open and fan is off makes no difference to the smoke escaping. Our chimney is over 3m tall so it has more than enough draft."", ""Don't waste your money on one of these pieces of crap! For a start the 20 minute timer on the fan will drive you insane. If you don't know what I'm talking about,  it basically means that if you open the door the fan won't come back on for 20 minutes.  Secondly they have very poor air draw, even with the vent open they still go out.

You need to have the house wide open and well ventilated the first few times you light the fire so pick days that are pleasant to make this process easier.    That is really the worse part so far of owning this cooker which has proven to pump out generous heat while cooking the best roasts and boiling the kettle next to a pot of soup or a frying pan sizzling away......', 'I used this stove for one winter. The second winter it started leaking a lot of smoke at the top seam  of the sidewalls - big cracks there, I spent the second winter trying to putty the cracks but no success so pretty much unusable after one year of use.  Very disappointed! I thought this was a decent quality brand,and paid a lot for the installation, too. The stove is in my kitchen.', 'Morning Pat,Apologize for the issue you are having with the unit. Please call us on 1300 554 155 and we will be able to advise further .Thank you, Nicolas', 'Within less than year (through summer) rust had developed on the top of the fire and the top door mechanism.  The damper top rear had ceased prob rust!  The whole damper mechanism was replaced and the door freed and rust scrubbed out. Now the rear damper has ceased again and the door mechanism has ceased again. Not happy thinking about a combustion stove that will burn through the night - these are not combustion !  This  will be more use than an oven that is hard to regulate the temp in! Burns through wood at an incredible rate and now hard to regulate.  Puts out mega heat though!', 'Hi Margaret E.

This can occur if you live near the sea or in damp areas such as rain fore...', 'Ive been through all of this with you. As this happened during the first 6-9 months.

I am originally Canadian and prefer wood heat in the winter. This stove is perfect for heating and cooking. We do not have water jacket hooked up so cannot comment on that. Once we adjusted the door gap with the key provided we found we could control the rate of wood burn and oven temperature. It took me about a week to gauge when to cook, how to adjust temp. The more coals the steadier the temp in the oven, get an oven thermometer for inside the oven and you will get a more accurate temp, the more ...', 'This is a great addition to any house. Not only do you get a great efficient wood fire but you can cook with it aswell, even put a kettle on top for a cuppa. When winter sets in, my electric oven and gas cooker very rarely get used.The firebox is of a decent size allowing large chunks of wood that will burn from nighttime into the morning keeping the house warm.

Noirot Spot Plus,3.6,"['We have a very small room and there hardly any warmth coming from the heater. Very disappointed especially for the cost of it. We are looking out for another heater to replace this one Wouldn’t recommend these.', 'The heater never gets the room to the desired temperature. It’s more like an oil heater you need to stand net to it for warmth. Probably only good for a small bedroom if anything.', 'The people reviewing this heater must be getting paid,what a waste of money,had to literally sit on top of it to get warm.Not satisfied with the way it heated up the room,waste of money', ""This heater is a gem. We bought three in 2009 and none of them have missed a beat since. We work from home and our house is a three bedroom open plan. These keep the temperature at our comfort of a constant 21 degrees Celsius all winter which we have found is efficient regarding electricity cost. You don't even know they are running until you go outside and realise how cold it is. The best thing is no drafts from heated air blowing around the room or concentrated warm spots, just a subtle overall warmth. Excellent value. Compact slim design. Lightweight and easy to clean."", 'Received my Noirot Spot Plus 2400W yesterday and used it immediately.  Light weight and easy to move from room to room.   I am impressed!!  Heats the room up nicely and it is a comfortable heat.Better than my zoned Aircon!', ""Using this outside in a large greenhouse (8m x 4m) and it's been going for 9 years.  Very well built,  no issues at all and it's consistent.  I maintain the heat outside at 14C approx each night but this can vary if we get a frost which is rare.  Keeps my tropical plants warm and never misses a beat.  Not sure how anyone could go through 3 heaters with less than a month of life with each one.  This is a high quality product that costs less to run than cheaper models.  Maybe the cheapest heating available if you are on a budget (or need one for your tropical plants)."", ""We have three sizes of the Noirot. We use this 2400W for our master bedroom, which is considerably larger than our other rooms. So far it has been up to the job. I love how we just set the desired temperature on the LCD, and the heater adjusts its own heating to get what we want. I know for a fact it doesn't use 2400W all the time as I monitor our energy usage on our Solar energy consumption app. That is, sometimes it only uses 1000W, and only goes up to 2400W when the room is really cold and the heater is just starting up. I suppose this automatic variable heating is how Noirot can be economical. Love the lifetime warranty too."", ""We have a few different sizes of the Noirot Spot Plus. This 1000W is for our kid's room. We decided to pay the extra $40 to get the one with timer, not so much for the timer itself, but for the LCD screen which allows us to set the exact temperature. This is simple to use. No need to worry about different heat settings. Just set the desired temperature, and the thing does its work."", 'Can’t believe how good this is! Heats our entire 2 bedroom apartment up and keeps it warm. The timer lets us set it up for mornings & evenings - would recommend to anyone with a small house', 'Well we have just moved into a new village retirement home  and was looking for a heater that if used properly give us quality and service  we went for this heater. We have a small computer room and a small tv room which does get cold besides it was just used to take the chill out of the room we already have a large heat pump that is enough to cover open plan of this house my sister in law has had one for 5 to 6 years and has not had a problem I will be buying a s cond one', ""- Absolutely no noise due to the monobloc heating element.  No expanding/contracting crack/noise.- Easy to use.  Haven't yet used the timer setting due to the fact that it was easy enough to turn on and wait for a bit for the room to heat up.  Room is about 10m2 so it is pretty quick to heat up.- Very happy with the purchase"", 'Not happy sadly.  I feel the Nobo which I had before beats it hands down.  Why I did not purchase another Nobo beats me. Have to turn reverse cycle on to boost the heat. Not feel it heats as well as Nobo. We have blocked kitchen and small hallway off with curtains to keep heat in lounge', 'Does a very good job of heating, no noise just hot. I would certainly buy one again, had it for a couple of years now and it does get a work out.', 'Heats room quickly and effectively  Previously any heater I tried irritated my eyes.  Only negative is that it is very hot to touch so not suitable if you have toddlers,although it can be mounted on the wall.', 'This is the perfect wall heater for our apartment living room. It works quickly and efficiently with zero noise. We also have vented heating/cooling aircon. We use the Noirot to supplement the aircon during the depths of winter.

Scandia Heat and Cook,3.5,"[""I installed mine in my covered in outdoor area in Dec 2016 . It gets used about 20 times a year . Fire box is disintergrating . Handle is jammed , leaks smoke , rusts like a beauty inside and out . Doesn't heat as purported . Absolute garbage quality steel . Not even going to bother with warranty . Going to throw it out . Do not buy one . Good idea , poor execution . Pics are of top hot plate and the under side of the hotplate inside the firebox . 4 years old ."", ""I run this stove 24/7 in the winter. Heats my small house, cooks my food and heats the hot water in combination with solar. A great asset. Great value for the modest price. Runs overnite easily as long as you have good quality wood. Easy to clean. On the minus side, it takes a fair bit of stoking to get the oven over 200°c and it gets hot on you legs standing in front of it to cook when you do that. The oven thermometer is difficult to read. The oven racks kept falling off their rails, after 2 sets of replacements didnt help i just welded a bit on the side of them.After 4 years it's still as good as new and I expect to get many more years out of it."", 'Works well in our house which is less than the 20 squares that the heater is meant to do. Looks great.  Cooks toast on top.  Kettle for coffee on top.  Pork chops are cooking right now on top. Cooks chicken in the oven (im sure it tasted better) .  A good starting smokeless procedure once you know how. Takes a while to heat up coz it is a solid nearly 1/4 ton of iron but once going keeps going for most of the night. Heat activated fan accessory on top helps to distribute the heat.', 'easy to light and it stays lit overnight without a problem. Im burning good red box.The older models have some consumables inside the firebox that could warp. Easy to change.', ""We didn't want to spend 4 grand on a nectre heater/oven and opted for the scandia, half the price of the nectre! Has not disappointed at all! Even while nobody recommended them. Easy to use, heats our stone cottage easy.Only had to adjust the door handle ones as it had a small gap, no dramas after that adjustment. You really have to stoke it up if you want to use the oven for bread etc as it doesn't go over 200 degrees easily. As a cook top it's great, use it lots of time in winter. We are happy with it and it definitely delivers for the price you pay for it."", 'Goes out all the time even when using multiple fire lighters & plenty of kindlingOften find unburnt timber in the firebox the next dayI only use demolition timber (jarrah) in it so it has zero moisture contentQuite often the house smells of smoke even if I have not opened it to top up woodDoes not heat anywhere near the SQM our old wood heater heated even though it claims to heat that sqm', 'What a great addition to our big tin shed that we holiday inPros:Huge firebox so can get big logs inGets the heat out fastPerfect for boiling the spuds, mulled wine and reheating the stewEasy to use controlsBakes great breadWill turn down enough to still have coals in the morningConsOven heat drops dramatically as the firebox fills with ash so must clean firebox out everytime before roasting or bakingExcellent value for the price', ""We had problems in the first year and our installer needed to replace the opening latch for inside the heater....in the end he had to cannibalise the one from the bottom oven as the replacement was too large!!!! And the door smoked in the first year, so our installer came around with a new cord for the door but guess what...too big also!!! He promised to come back with a replacement for both but never did. So we have a heater that barely functions,, is never really hot and is a great disappointment. ANd it certainly does not heat up the area. At this point we are looking to upgrade to a better and bigger unit. At this point we don't know if Scandia or the installer is hopeless. But I do know that we are cold!"", 'My stone cottage is so small that everything in it has to have more than one purpose. The heat and cook wood heater suits me just fine. There is plenty of firewood on the property and the burner box large enough for the chainsawed logs. I cook all the meals on the hot plate with the added bonus of an oven. The oven does require extra heat but once you gain experience together with the inbuilt thermometer roasted meals are easy to cook.The stone chimney also heats the upstairs bedroom and this keeps heating costs to absolute minimum. Perhaps more suited to the country than the city it is my most important winter appliance.', 'The Gourmet equivalent stove was more than $1000 above the $2000 we paid for this stove. Is it perfect? No, of course not and most of the problems I have experienced over the last three winters of use are covered here already. Is it great value for money? I believe so.We only intended to use it as a lounge room fireplace doing the occasional meal but in winter it does most of the heavy cooking, saving us a lot of bottled gas.
