Mr. Heater MH4GC 4000 BTU Radiant Propane Portable Golf Cart Cup Holder Heater,73.29,281 sold,"['the actual heater is great. Easy to use and works every time. Problem is with the lower portion that fits into the cup holder. Entire unit is extremely top heavy and can very easily tip out of the cup holder. The fit into the cup holder in my club car golf car is loose and poorly designed. I would not reccomend this item.', 'Have bought 3 different style heaters in 3 years to use golfing (with cart covers) and this Mr. Heater unit is the best. Regarding cost, starting ease, overall warmth, and quality construction this is by far the best heater on the market. Four players in my gaggle of friends (playing in the winter) own this unit and are thoroughly pleased with its performance and durability. If you winter golf, Buy It!', 'I last owned a Coleman brand Golf Cart Heater....it lasted about 10 years and finally died. I purchased this MH4GC unit next and it is not as good as the Coleman unit, but the Coleman unit is no longer made, so I\'m stuck with this one. Couple of issues...first and foremost, this heater is way top heavy so it will NOT stay put in a golf cart cup holder...the slightest bump and it flies right out of the cart\'s cup holder and if it lands on a person, they will get burned....I know, because it happened to me! I now have it ""tied"" in place with a bungee cord when I use it. No way could the manufacturer have tested this properly...my golf carts are 2017 model electric EZ Go Golf Carts. Second, there is no variable control on the heat...it\'s either wide open or shut off. I\'m not crazy about that, it does consume fuel at a higher rate than one with an adjustable propane flow valve, but you\'re compelled to live with it if you want heat. If I can find another option when this one dies, I will undoubtedly try it.', ""Pretty simple to operate. Screw in 1 lb camper gas canister, press 'on' button a couple of times until it lights and you have heat. To turn it off hit the 'off' button. I ordered it for use in a golf cart.  Nothing to put together other than putting the canister into the holder and setting it into a cup holder."", ""I had to ding this product because the poorly designed tip-over switch defeats the premise of the product.At even the tiniest bump in the cart path or fairway this heater turns itself off -- you will have to re-light 30+ times per round.It's a shame because it does put out nice heat and is otherwise effective and generally a fair price.The manufacturer missed the mark here."", 'Used it in my side by side this past week while hunting. Takes the rocky roads really well, the stiff north wind did blow it out a couple of times while driving around but overall it worked really well. I would recommend it and it really helps keep you warm while driving around the deer lease.', 'This heater works great in a covered cart, in fact it can get too warm, even when the outside temps  are in upper 30s and lower 40s.  In an open cart you feel the heat when the cart is stationery, however when moving or winds over 10 mph you can feel the heat.  The holder works in the smaller cart cup.Suggest they need to have an adjustable temp knob.All in all, I like the Mr. Heater portable golf cart heater.   ', ""I have something similar to this in my shop, but they are bigger, but when they heat up the screens glow orange, this little one doesn't do that so I thought it wasn't working correctly. But if you do like the instructions say and make sure the pilot is lit. Then leave it alone it will start producing heat. "", ""Mr. Heater that I got was brand new and worked great.  I even got it 1 day earlier than expected.  I've already used it 3 times and it has worked great!"", ""I read all the reviews I could find on this heater before purchase, so expected a good product.  It had to sit under the tree for a few days but Christmas morning it was installed in the cart!  It has been out on one excursion and all the guys wanted to 'ride in the warm cart'.  The hubbby is more than pleased!It sits steady in the front cup holder, is cool to the touch on all sides (well not the front of course), and works instantly!

Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681),51.3,94 sold,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product? It really depends upon your application need. I put this in my truck due to no floor board heat. It does help but the heat is so so at best.

"Sengoku CTN-110 KeroHeat Portable Radiant Kerosene Space Heater, 10,000 BTU",184.98,20 sold,"[""I currently have a couple of these kerosene heaters and I like to rotate them out every so often, as to not let the wick from just one get all of the use over the winter season. I have never had any problem with this heater and I would never go thru a winter without a couple of them. I always try to have a back up to what I use the most of, so I won't be without one working, just in case. They put out excellent heat in my room size of 15' X 24'. Also great if the power ever was to go out for a while during cold times. When the heater is fired up and the mantle is all glowing without any flame going higher than the mantle, I notice very little kerosene smell. Mine have been a life saver over the years that I've owned them. Bruce; TN."", ""I was not happy when I first got this heater.  The flame adjustment was only usable when it is in the all the way up position.  It should start out high and then after it mellows out you adjust it down.  Also the fumes were terrible!  I could not use it indoors.  I had tried it 3 times and would have sent it back but as it was heavy and a large box I just didn't want the hassle.  I pulled it off the back porch last night for one last try.  It worked great!  I stood right over it and inhaled and no fumes at all!  I was using K1 kero at 4.99 a gallon for indoor use.  So...it could be when a heater is new it has to burn a few tanks to get to where it needs to be.

Dr. Heater 240 Volt 5600 Watt Garage Workshop Portable Industrial Space Heater,75.99,130 sold,"['This does all I need for taking the chill off our two bay shop at ""Coop\'s Miata"" in Maple Valley Washington.It is quiet and efficient. The only negative thing is the short chord and the odd plug. I had to make a 20 ft extension chord with adaptation for my shop 240 service. Ended up changing the plug on the heater chord as well.  Couldn\'t find a chord female plug for this style. Worked out that I ended up using the same mail plug I use for my Tig. Word of caution: use the right gauge wire and keep it less than 25 feet.', ""I purchased this heater in 01/2013 to replace a propane bottle heater.  It is much safer than propane and the fan circulates the heat.  I have been extremely happy with this heater as it has worked great to heat my insulated garage/shop during the cold N. IL winters.  I gave it four stars due to the fact that the fan motor uses sleeve bearings and not ball so any dirt that accumulates on the blades causes vibration and wear on the bearings.  It is important to keep the fan blades clean to reduce wear and extend the life.  I suggest cleaning every season.  I just completed cleaning blades and fan bearings and the heater works like new again.  Very easy to do with just a few screws to remove cover and fan  Don't get me wrong this is a great heater for the price.  I will look into the model 966 which has a heavier duty fan when this wears out. "", ""Don't get me wrong they put out heat... But not like people brag about on them... If your in a two bay garage it will take the chill out in roughly in a hour with the door closed. Lots of 220 power used in an hr. If you put it beside you when working on a car in the open it cycles off and on the heating element a lot as if room temperature has been reached. Cold hot cold hot.... Wasn't worth adding a 220 outlet. Says industrial use only on the warning label on top, exactly what industry would have been nice to know... Because  commercial mechanic work does not qualify...."", ""I spent almost a couple hours reading and researching several heaters to help for winter work in the garage. My final decision in this unit was the power of the fan. It was much stronger BLOWER MOTOR than many others. It is built tough/rugged like (old school box style construction). I figured with the amount of electricity this draws and the fan strength, I'd get e bit more bang for the buck. I was wrong... I've seen more impressive 110 models in the past over this. Unfortunate results for the amount of electricity you pour out. It also has a horrible cool draft off one corner. How does a heater blow a cool breeze with the hot? (Maybe the blower is to strong for the heating element?) Even standing in front of this unit, It was not impressive on the heat being generated. If you don't care about electricity and need to blow a little bit of heat a distance then I would suggest this unit for you.... everyone else, I suggest researching other units."", 'When I received this heater the box was in perfect shape, no signs of damage, but when I opened it and pulled the heater out the fan was laying in the bottom not attached to the bracket inside. Pulled the cover off and screws totally missing, fan and inside of heater looked as if it had been running with the fan hitting inside of housing. Screws not inside the heater nor in the box. Got the fan straightened out and bought screws from hardware store, remounted fan and turned the heater on. It started working and seemed to be okay. The heater coil is not suppose to turn red while it is running however on day 2 the coil is starting to turn red while heating so the coil is not going to last very long before it shorts out. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time to work on it to get it running. If I had just wanted a fan I could have bought several fans from Walmart for what this cost.', ""Using on construction site.  Keeps 3 bedroom townhouses at 70 degrees.Bought 15 open box and 1 new.  Could not tell the difference.  One heater had a loose fan bracket.Tightened screws and it was good.  Another heater had a fan that rattled. Had some play on the drive shaft.  Added a washer and it was good as new.  Can't complain because they were 1/2 the price of new ones.  Wish they had a different plug.  A dryer or range end would be better."", 'This is to backup the same model in use for a couple years, they work very well. Only complaint is new one has a high pitched fan motor whine when the unit is not under a heat load with just the fan running.  ', 'An excellent buy. Good strong heat for  an old 20 x 20 wood garage with a high peak ceiling, and no insulation in very cold weather. Had to change the 30 amp 220v electrical receptacle, but that was it.

It’ll keep me nice and toasty this winter since my steam radiator barely works in my apartment!  ', ""I bought this heater to use to warm a living room with vaulted ceilings. It has a cool LED flame effect that can be used alone or in conjunction with heat.  I find that the lowest setting is more than adequate for keeping the living room warm. The only thing that could be better would be if it had a thermostat. Otherwise it's pretty much perfect.  The fan is silent and I have to get next to it to barely hear it running. I'd highly recommend it to anyone. "", ""Produces the right amount of heat for the space I'm where I have it.  Nothing bad about this unit.  Highly recommended."", 'I love this small heater!

Lasko 5307 Portable Electric 1500W Room Oscillating Ceramic Tower Space Heater,59.0,53 sold,"['I live in Oakland, California in the USA. The usual temperature here during winter nights goes between 35 to 40 something degrees Fahrenheit. I use it to warm up a small room (10 feet x 10 feet x 8 feet, without insulation).

Usually, I could turn the heater off for about half an hour before I need to turn it on again.', 'Great small room space heater.  Simple controls.  Quiet but not so quiet you forget and leave it on.

A reliable workhorse, with a bonus: It turns into a no-heat fan in the summer!!  Fits compactly under my desk."", 'This little heater has amazing power. It is small . I use it on a medium setting and it heats a very large area. No need to turn it all the way up. I’m very happy with this heater.', ""I've had many space heaters over the years, but this one is a gem: a high-quality product that works well and quickly. It's the quietest heater I've ever had. The oscillating heating tower guarantees the whole room gets warm. The tower design is sleek, and the whole unit takes up little space. This machine has heft and seems well made. Though it's about 3-times taller than it is wide, most of the weight is in the base, which makes it feel solid and not prone to tipping over easily. I'm so in love with this baby that I'm buying a second -- FOR MY 3-ROOM APARTMENT!! lolI wholeheartedly recommend this product."", ""Received this tower fan and it's very sturdy, has several settings: air, low heat and higher heat. Large enough to heat a medium sized room; only complaint is it smells a bit antiseptic."", 'I have not actually used my LASKO 5370 Ceramic/ Oscillating Heater yet. I purchased the LASKO Name. Have always had longevity with their products. I highly recommend.', ""Very appropriate for heating a small space - generates desired heat; good price and good design...would have been rated a '5 star' if it has an auto shut off when desired room temp is reached."", 'This product works well, is easy to move around to different locations, and keeps me cozy when I am chilled.  I would recommend it to others!  ', ""Almost bought the more expensive model because it came with a remote. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and found one in here!

"Mr. Heater Buddy Series Hose Assembly - 10-ft., Model# F273704",42.29,141 sold,"[""What I like about this hose: The quality seem very good.&amp; it seals great at both ends. So far I have user about 10x of the 20lb propane tanks through this hose without the (oil trapping) filter and my Mr. Heater - Flex still works as good as when it was brand new. The pilot lights instantly and the burner is ready to turn on within 5 seconds of lighting the pilot. Heater is not showing any signs of being clogged by the oils found the cheaper propane hoses. Per Mr. Heater If you're using a portable propane heater, this IS the hose to get &amp; it pays for itself with the first year. Yes it cost more but you do not need to buy the over priced and sometimes very hard to find disposable filters that Mr. heater recommends replacing every year. Since you payed good money for your heater, why not protect it from clogging by buying this good quality hose. When I bought my Mr Heater, the filters that all the other hoses require were out of stock at  Mr. Heater Lowes, Home Depot &amp; Amazon ect. and where I did find them they were between 2-4 times the normal price = ouch. With the supply chain issues (which could happen again) I didn't want to get stuck needing to use the heater but having to chance using it with a cheaper hose that can clog it with oil (if) I could not get a new filter in the years to come or having to re-use and old contaminated (saturated) filter. I think of this superior quality hose as a good insurance policy for the heater staying reliable for years to come.*What I don't like about it:Just 1 issue, On the package it says that handling it (probably the rubber? part) can expose the person to some gnarly chemicals and to wash the hands immediately after.  Maybe just wear some gloves. It would be nice if Mr. Heater could redesign this hose to have a more user friendly (less toxic) coating on the exterior."", 'Product was as described and a bit cheaper than other places had it listed for. Cant wait to take it camping with us now and run the heater all night with no worry of having to get up in the middle of the night and change little green bottles.

Comfort Zone Electric Heater Furnace Safety Overheat Protection Ceiling Mount,147.17,30-day returns,"[""easy install, seems to be made well.  love the three heat settingsall parts were present and was packaged well. upon install, turned on power, turned thermostat knob and bam...had instant heat as I had expected...bring on the cold!!.however, one feature that I wish it had was a delayed fan off to cool the heating coils after use. when you rotate the thermostat knob, the fan shuts down immediately, leaving the hot coils to cool off too slowly. also, the unit I received didn't have a visible mark on the thermostat knob for easy identification of position (easily fixed). overall, nice product for the money"", ""So much easier than installing a gas furnace and vent.  Fan creates a full circular heat draft all the way around my 20x20 detached garage.  Heats up quickly and I can then turn it down.  Thermostat works well.  I had a 30 amp welder plug in a good location, so mounted it on the ceiling and used a 10' dryer plug cord.  Quick and easy installation.  Should have done this years ago.  No more freezing with a little space heater."", 'I recommend knowledgäble HVAC guy to add the external thermostat if you need one.  I have high ceilings and wanted to use my mouting system that âttaches to the walls in a corner - no ceiling holes, but two nights of engineering the aluminum mounts.  Hester has been set on low since I installed it and let the Honeywell electronic thermostât do the work.  Waiting for ã heating bill to begin tuning it for optimãl settings depending on weather.  But garage can get hot it works so well.', ""I purchased this heater to use in a 666 sq ft, 4-car, uninsulated, vaulted ceiling garage.  Obviously this is meant to be used in a smaller, more insulated setting.  I wanted to try just one first, and then add as necessary.The heater itself seems to be well-built as far as structure, and designed well as far as installation and operation.  Including running wiring and building a wall mount (vaulted ceiling so no ceiling studs), it took 2-3hrs to get up and running.In my large uninsulated setting, over the course of 3-4hrs, it was able to raise the temperature from 25*F to 45*F, roughly speaking.  In other words, from intolerable to tolerable.  Which is about what I expected from it.  I think it would do quite well at maintaining a higher temperature if I were to use my propane 'salamander' to initially heat the space.Based on other's reviews and my own experience, there seems to be a major quality control concern in the assembly line for these regarding the fan nut.  I was unaware of this until after it was installed, but I'm almost certain I have the same issue as almost everyone else.  Before mounting the heater there was a nut and washer rattling around inside.  After a semi-thorough check, I figured it was an erroneous leftover.  Having read the reviews and after hearing a small rattle when the heater runs, I will be dismounting and tearing it down to install that nut properly.  This is both an inconvenience and really a potential danger.  For that I've removed a star from the rating.That being said, I will be purchasing another one, possibly two more.  Can't beat the price to performance ratio anywhere.Edit from the future:  I bought another one, slightly updated since the first.  This one had no problems and even runs quieter.  Awesome."", ""This heater does a great job heating my 24'x30' insulated shop. I have it on a Honeywell line thermostat, and typically keep it at 40* to keep water lines from freezing, but when I'm ready to work in the ship I just turn it up and in 20 minutes it's nice and toasty. The other day it was 30* outside, but on high this ran for less than 5 minutes every 20-30 minutes.The only potential negative to be aware of is that it has a slight whistle when it's running. It's enough that I think about it every time it starts up, but it's not enough to be a nuisance.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase; it was easy to install, and is cost-effective for the job I needed it to do."", ""Fast shipping.Well packaged.All metal construction.Enough detail in instructions,easily installed,best of all:heater works great.No issues so far.I heat a decent size 2 car garage and this is all I need.Recomend a ceiling fan to force the heat down,same thing with all of 'em.I can not stand beneath this heater when it is on high,it is way beyond my expectations.It is not very big or impressive,but do not let that part fool ya,it is a good heater.I have left the thermostat inside the heater,so far this is working fine."", 'I have used 4 times now and I really like it. If you have a insulated two car garage this heater will do the job nicely.It only took about 30 minutes to go from 30° to  62° in an hour it was 71° had to turn it down to work though. I like it 57° to 63° when working on a project. This heater is perfect for my needs. Little less than $100 too!👍', ""I'm happy with this heater and wish I'd found it years ago. I installed it in my basement workshop and it is way better than the big baseboard heater and kerosene heater I'd been using for many years. It's quiet and easy to install and heats the basement better than I'd anticipated. The workmanship and quality are great and I especially like that the sheet metal parts are post painted as opposed to crummy pre-paint and so all the sheet metal cut edges and corners are painted and nice and smooth and burr free."", 'I use this heater turned down low just to knock the edge off the cold so I can work comfortably in my 3 car garage shop.  I have it set on about 1/3 of its capacity and it keeps the garage at about 55- 60, the way I like it.  If I were to turn it up on high it would make the garage toasty warm.  The installation was straight forward and simple.  I bought a plug, 15 ft. of 10-3 service cord and a cord grip to make the installation. I plug it into my 220 volt welder receptacle when I want to have heat.  Wish I had found it years ago.', 'Great heat output, replaced my floor oil heater and small plug in with this one.  Only reason I gave it a 4 not 5 is that # 1 the fan blade was loose when I got it and the simple mechanism makes a rattling noise that is not necessary.  It only has a moving fan part but is kinda noisy.  Heats very well.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

New Lasko CD08200 Bathroom Heater White Ceramic,44.99, ,"[""I put this bathroom heater in my bedroom to compare with another good Lasko room heater of similar size and the same 1500 W but with different features. I like the angle of the heat blast from this bathroom heater better for when I'm sitting on my bed getting dressed in front of the heater, I am happier with the other in my office. which has a steeper angle of blast and a thermostat.I also use this bathroom heater in the bathroom for which it was intended. I wanted it above the sink level for safety, as there's nowhere else to put the heater but on the sink counter.  I  turned a fire safe small ceramic square kleenex holder upside down, and the heater's feet fit nicelyinside.This bathroom heater is convenient because of the one press button for a preset one hour of high heat for quick warmups such as in the bathroom or when getting dressed. No fussing with buttons. It also has High and Low settings that run without a timer.I also noticed that some sellers were saying their heaters were OK for the bathroom but the actual manufacturer did not.  This Bathroom heater is designed for the bathroom.  I'm not sure if the tripper in the cord is necessary if the outlet has one too, as many houses do these days in any water environment such as the bathroom or the kitchen.  I'm guessing the tripper in the plug reacts to the unit rather than the wall socket."", ""This heater does an excellent job of putting out a lot of air with the fan and also Heats the room excellently. For my application I'm using it in a fifth wheel trailer bathroom which is fairly small but one of the problems I'm having with the heater is I'm using a different thermostat on it that is more accurate to turn on and off and the heater shuts off and doesn't come back on when I use the thermostat on it so what you need to do is put something on the round button on top of the heater and tape it down to hold the button down all the time so that thermostat that I've got set up works properly and we'll kick the heater on when the temperature drops or more so when I want to heat the bathroom during a certain time of the day like when I take a shower.Otherwise the heater is an excellent heater and I would highly recommend anybody to buy it very good quality."", 'The heater is modern in design. It has a one hour feature that I love. I turn it on , shower get dressed in a warm bathroom, never have to wonder if I left it running. It automatically shuts off after 1 hour.', ""1. easy to turn on and off2. heats up fast3. has 1-hour auto shutoff4. very sturdy design, not likely to tip over5. made for humid areas like bathroomsbonus: it's cute!"", ""Here's the story:  To have my small bathroom warm when I get up in the morning for my shower, I had a small ceramic 1500 Watt heater connected into a wall timer to turn on automatically, and if I forgot (which I often did) to turn off automatically. With this Lasko heater, I tap the top when I'm ready to shower and it turns on high for one hour. Firstly, I don't have to remember to turn it off. Secondly, the velocity of the hot air coming out is so high that the bathroom heats up much quicker than my other heater, even though the wattage of both units is the same. This saves my electric bill.It seems to be good, quality wise, but it's only a month old now so we'll see.  November, 2020A note:  After it's turned off, and the top button (the big and only one) is tapped, it starts at the timed one hour 1500 Watt setting automatically."", ""It is difficult to find a space heater that is specifically for bathroom use. I was happy to find this one at this price and good reviews! It does exactly what I need it to do, I warm up my bathroom before a shower as my heat does not do that well - North side of house in Wisconsin! I will see how it holds up this winter, but so far very pleased with it's performance."", 'Works great! Instant heat . Small size is great. Comes with wet location plug  &amp; cord', ""Perfect replacement for my old heater that finally died. Small, lightweight, gets super warm in my little bathroom. Like that it's specifically made to use in a bathroom. Warming, the front grill can get hot!"", 'This little heater has all the power i need to heat up the bathroom in a hurry. Set it for an hour walk away and it turns itself off. Very nice 👍 made for humid bathroom areas. Very attractive too.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Lasko Electric Oscillating Ceramic 1500-Watt Tower Heater 5307.,29.99, ,"['I live in Oakland, California in the USA. The usual temperature here during winter nights goes between 35 to 40 something degrees Fahrenheit. I use it to warm up a small room (10 feet x 10 feet x 8 feet, without insulation). I usually turn it on with maximum temperature and speed for around 20 minutes. The room would be heat up to reasonably warm. Usually, I could turn the heater off for about half an hour before I need to turn it on again.', 'Great small room space heater.  Simple controls.  Quiet but not so quiet you forget and leave it on.

I use it on a medium setting and it heats a very large area. No need to turn it all the way up. I’m very happy with this heater.', ""I've had many space heaters over the years, but this one is a gem: a high-quality product that works well and quickly. It's the quietest heater I've ever had. The oscillating heating tower guarantees the whole room gets warm. The tower design is sleek, and the whole unit takes up little space. This machine has heft and seems well made. Though it's about 3-times taller than it is wide, most of the weight is in the base, which makes it feel solid and not prone to tipping over easily. I'm so in love with this baby that I'm buying a second -- FOR MY 3-ROOM APARTMENT!! lolI wholeheartedly recommend this product."", ""Received this tower fan and it's very sturdy, has several settings: air, low heat and higher heat.

In a season, the heater was hopelessly clogged and useless.  These filters will prevent that from happening.

Comfort Zone Mini personal heater CZ25,14.99, ,"[""Nothing out there quite like  this little gem. I read the reviews stating that it is noisy. Yes a fan hums but this is quite mild in this unit and needed to move the hot air toward you. The only problem is the 3 small feet are hard plastic and so the unit vibrates. This causes extra unwanted noise and movement. The issue is easily solved by capping the feet with rubber tips found at any decent hardware .store for $1.50. This STOPS the movement and extra noise completely. Just make sure you get the right size and slip them on. Problem solved. One other thing is that the dial for the settings is fine and not difficult for anyone who is alive to turn if you are over 2 years old!  Reviewers are confused because the dial snaps into position for a positive lock on the setting. This is a good thing! The heat output is adequate at the low setting and the high setting is great for a quick warm up in a small room. What you get can be compared to a 1500 watt hair dryer in heat output. So the Low setting is one third of that and the high setting is two thirds of that. For a safe heater with a footprint of a about a standard napkin it's a good deal. It's small and simple to use anywhere you need it. I have mine on my night stand in the bedroom at the moment but if my girlfriend moves in the it probably goes to her private bathroom to pamper her. Wish me luck and hope this helps you decide. :) Bill"", ""I bought a small heater so as not to run my electricity bill up high and I also wanted the small size so I could push it under my couch when I'm not using it/turned off.  I use it to keep my feet and legs warm when I'm sitting and watching tv because I live in the bottom floor apartment with a concrete slab under my carpeting and the floor gets very gold.  But the heater does the trick.  Sometimes the low setting isn't low enough though and I have to push the heater further away.  I never use the high setting.  If it last a few years, I'll be happy with it."", 'Was specifically looking for a small but powerful heater for my bathroom and this one is PERFECT.  Don\'t let the size fool you because it pack a punch!  Heats immediately, and actually blows the HOT air out within seconds. This was on ""high"" right out of the box. Multiple settings are a plus as well as the ""fan"" setting being very useful, so it is useable year-round. It\'s smaller than what I thought it would be, but I\'m very happy about that because I have limited space to put it, but a decent area to cover. Safe as well; no blazing hot elements close to the surface to accidentally touch.  Unit also stays cool to the touch.', 'The heater itself is built well but very small and provides limited heat. I bought it for my fairly small bathroom and in that small enclosed space it does the job ok. I liked the small form factor as it fits into a small space between the sink unit and the wall so in that regard it is perfect.If you were thinking of getting this model to heat a normal sized room then I would get a larger model because as I said this thing is tiny.', 'Heater works good for a small heater.', 'Strongest portable heater I have purchased.  Highly recommend this heater.  ', 'I received the item, it does not heat up.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Mr Heater MH15C Heater/Cooker 8000-15000BTU,65.08,30-day returns,"['I just replaced this unit after my other unit failed after 40 years.  Most products don’t make it 4 years.  I use it ice fishing for warm lunches, in the ice hut for warmth, tent while hunting for a quick morning coffee and in my truck emergency provisions for driving and living in the high Colorado mountains.  As with any propane product, always properly ventilate and don’t fall asleep while in use.', ""Just used it once briefly and seemed to light easily and generate solid radiant heat for a 1lb cylinder heater.  Nice to have the convertible stand for cooking too but haven't tried that and may not."", 'Got this to heat my ice fishing shelter.. It works great and the three settings make it easy to regulated the temperature', ""We bought this heater for our grandson to use in his deer blind. We have several of these and I and my wife set together in a pop-up blind in any weather and have nothing bad to say about this heater. It allows us to cook lunch make coffee and tea which makes for memorable occasion's.I have had issues in the past with this heater and moisture in the propane hose, I use a Mr. Heater in line filter and have eliminated the problem. this is not and isolated issue with this heater as Mr. Heater recommends the inline filter with the big buddy heater which also works to keep moisture out of the propane line."", ""I have been looking for a decent little heater for my hunting blind. The fact that this one only cost me $36. and that it doubles as a cooker compelled me to try it out. I have only tested it at home but it seems to perform as described and I'm confident it will do the job I bought it for. "", 'I like the fact it heats and can also cook on it boils water fast', 'works great. i use a twenty pound bulk tank with hose but ponnd bottles are fine. ', ""Heater/ cooker works well.  Easy and puts out a good amount of heat.  Kinda large if your using for camping, and don't have a lot of packing room.  Being able to use it as a stove is a bonus.   I purchased this one and the one that attached to the larger propane tanks. Both were worth the price."", 'works great just might have to get another', 'This little heater is quick and easy to set up. A small propane canister will give you lots of heat for about 3 hours on high or 4-5hours on low setting.

NEW Roadpro 12v RPSL-681 12-volt Ceramic Heater/fan (rpsl681) FREE SHIPPING. ,39.5, ,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product? It really depends upon your application need. I put this in my truck due to no floor board heat. It does help but the heat is so so at best. The blow power is very minimal but it does help for my application']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Brand NEW Mr. Heater F273701 5ft Propane Hose Assembly,24.9, ,"[""I bought two propane hoses 3 years ago, this one and one like it from the sports dept at Walmart.  After two years, the Walmart hose split at the male connector end and began leaking propane and it was really stiff, especially in cold weather.  This hose by Mr. Heater is still flexible and doesn't leak after 3 years use.  I use this hose to connect from my 20 lb tank to a propane torch nozzle.  I just bought another Mr. Heater hose to replace the Walmart hose. "", ""This enables you to run your Mr.Heater heater/burner on refillable 5 gal. propane bottles. I'm going to use this for the next time my power is out in winter. Last winter brought a once in 25 years snow storm that took power out for five days.

"Lasko 100 MyHeat Portable Personal Electric 200W Ceramic Space Heater, Black",36.99,75 sold,"['I bought this unit to build a yogurt maker.  My unit consumed 190 watts on a kill-a-watt meter.  This was much more heat than I needed.  I opened up the unit to see what I could change.  The internal connections are soldered.  I was quite surprised.  The heating element is center tap so it functions as two parallel heaters.  I cut a wire so I only use half the heater and it works very well.  It is a little over 100 watts now.   This could be used to make a dehydrator also.  I bought a $10 digital temperature to control this.  Yes I am an engineer but this project was easily within the capabilities of handy people.  Before messing with it the heater was surprisingly effective as a desk top heater or something like that to keep your hands warm.  Bear in mind the heat output is like that of two 100 watt incandescent light bulbs.  It has no tilt sensor so works in any attitude but does have an effective thermal switch that shuts it off.  ', 'Very simple little heater a bit taller then a coffie mug, the vent big as a baseball.  No adjustments, just an on/off switch puts out heat of around 150°F at 3"" away, 115° at 6"", 90° at 1 foot, 80° at 2 feet, which is great in  a small area, or spacific body parts (feet, face, hands or core) in a large area without worry of tripping breakers.  Just used my little cen-tech temperature gunto take the measurements.', 'I use this to heat my dog house.  I live in Iowa and so winter nights can be quite cold 5-6 months per year.  This is the 2nd one.  The first lasted 4 years.  Its very reliable.  I mount it on the outside of the dog house and direct the heat through a vent to the inside.  It works very well in the tough conditions I use it.   It puts out just the right amount of heat to heat the dog house without getting the inside to warm for the dog.  On cold nights my dog only comes out to eat, drink, and potty.  Then back in he goes.  As you can see my dog is spoiled. ', 'I just got this today and I already love it. At first I thought it was going to be a heater that filled a small room with heat but it does not, instead after some adjustment I have this tiny heater blowing on me while I sit at my computer desk to warm me up!.So really it should be blowing on you to get the ""Personal"" benefit out of it. would I recommend it? Defiantly yes! Especially for those cold days in cold rooms this Personal heater does make a difference!', 'Love this thing! It was just what I was looking for. Puts out great heat right where I need it. I keep it near for my chilly feet. Great quality and low cost to operate. The casing stays cool when operating too. Always use any heat device responsibly.I am so glad I made this purchase.', 'The Lasko 100 heater has worked very well since purchasing a month ago. I use it in a cool basement where I have my office and it has helped keep my feet and hands nice and toasty while on the computer. It also helps keep some of my tropical houseplants at a constant warmer temperature along with a plant light I am also using. It puts out a fair amount of heat and is surprisingly quiet. It has only two settings, off and on but that suits my needs very well. It never gets overly hot to the touch and is not top heavy so I do not worry about it tipping over. A bonus is that the little unit looks pretty good too and does not take up much space if that is a concern.', 'I have an office with limited power available.  A normal heater would blow the circuit breaker.  So, I needed a low power heater.  This is it.  It consumes 200 watts and the circuit breaker does not blow.  No it does not put out as much heat as the other heaters.  It consumes less energy and puts out less heat.  But, that was what I needed.  it was either this heater or nothing.  Keeps my feet warm.', 'this little heater did a great job, i bought it for my rv and it warmed it up in no time....not for winter use, but a great spring/fall supplement heater for those times you just want to take the dampness and chill out.', 'My office building does not allow space heaters that put out over 200 watts.  My office is cold, so I bought this small heater out of desperation.  It does not heat the office, but it definitely help me to stay warm when it is at my feet or on top of my desk while I am working.Grant G, Spokane Washington', 'i bought the heater for myself a month or so ago needing extra heat at night time. i was in a motorcycle accident and was paralyzed in 09 and im on blood thinners which in the winter you freexe. i put it on the table next to bed and i couldnt believe how much heat comes from this heater. anyways as far as the quality its great. the simple on off with no adjustment is perfect. if it gets too warm simply move it away a couple inches and vise versa. i think its a super nice heater for the price i highly recommend it. office, desktop, table top, night stand etc.... great little heater A1 in my book. brian']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

"Broan-NuTone Ceiling Heater 1,250-Watt Surface-Mount Fan-Forced",111.9,30-day returns,"['the product shown is not what I received.  the illustration is the wire coil unit and the 157 is a solid core heat unit, kinda like an electric stove top.  I have not used it enough to know if it works as well as the coiled wire.  It takes longer to heat up than the coil type.  I am unsure what happens if the unit overheats.  It has some type of thermal overload resistor, but not sure if it will reset like the thermal unit on the coil type.also my unit had been opened and was missing a screw and the center name plate, but I was able to use those parts from the old unit I was replacing.', 'The heater was purchased to replace an old model ceiling heater.  This one, manufactured by Broan, is installed in an elevator.  Normally, elevators are placed inside the building for use and uses the ambient air to heat/cool the space.  This particular elevator is installed on an outside wall and ambient temperatures are hard to come by.The Broan unit is turned on during the fall/winter season and runs almost constantly.  It keeps the elevator well heated.  The installation of the unit is very simple and can readily be installed over a 4x4 electrical box.  After the unit has been in use for awhile, the metal screen covering may begin to rattle.  There is a single phillips-head screw that holds the screen on.  This screw will loosen and requires tightening periodically.  Another alternative is to use a ""Lock-Tite"" product to secure the screw.  I\'ve tried using lock washers, but they do not hold very well.Overall, the unit is durable.  The small motor that rotates the fan needs to be cleaned and lubricated periodically.  At times, I\'ve found the fan speed slowing down and have had to clean/lubricate the motor to get the fan up to speed.  If the fan motor decreases too much, there is a thermal heat sensor that will cause the heater element to turn off.  This prevents the heater element to overheat and cause a fire.  Overall, a decent little unit that thats the chill off the space during the winter months.  Because of my search for this product, I purchased two of them.  One of them is in \'bench stock\' in case the first one should fail.', 'Don\'t know why I waited so long to purchase and install a ceiling heater in our Master Bath.  After one week of use, I am very pleased and hoping that it will provide many years of service and comfort.  I was disappointed to discover that there was no  installation  hardware included with the fan.  The instructions indicated that it was  ""easy to install"" - only if you have your own hardware available.', 'I bought this to replace a Broan model 154 that lasted about 2 years.  So far it works great.  It heats the bathroom nicely and is much quieter because it has a solid metal heating element instead of the thin coiled wire element of the model 154.  This type of element should be more efficient and last longer as well, but only time will tell.', 'Installed it overhead just as I step out of the shower. Works on a timer that I set for approx. 10 minutes. The family likes it also.', 'Improved design replaced old one like it that stopped working after several years', 'This device stopped working in a week after installation. The power to the heater tested good.', ""Love this little heater, just renivating my Mum's home.   It's so nice to have this little heater in the basement bath.  Very reasonable in price and a nice touch!!!"", 'Brand new unused, unopened.  Excellent purchase. ', 'The Broan 157 ceiling heater is a great upgrade from the "" twisted wire element "" heater.

"Mr. Heater Propane Portable Heater 9,000 BTU Radiant W/ Tip-Over Safety Switch",96.64,30-day returns,"[""I bought this heater for my small garage workshop. My electric heater kept tripping the breaker while using other equipment. I was afraid of other gas heaters due to their carbon monoxide emissions. This was one of the few gas heaters rated for indoor use. It also has an oxygen depletion detector and tip over cut off feature which I thought was very important.This heater silently keeps my shop warm in even the coldest temperatures and can also be attached to a 20 pound propane tank with an accessory hose ~ which I also purchased. I've run this heater for up to 6 hours uninterrupted with no noticeable fumes and since all the heat is focused out the front, it can be set close to a wall with no worries.I know I'm going to get a lot of use out of this heater. It was a very reasonable price and filled my needs perfectly. Highly recomend the Mr. Heater Buddy for heating small spaces."", 'Here in Monterey County the weather can be colder in the evenings. At my home we cut of the central heating back in ‘88 so we all dress up like eskimos to keep warm. Don’t get me wrong. We do use electric heaters in certain areas but after purchasing this Portable Propane heater, it was Heaven sent. I recommend this product with all my heart. It is compact. It is durable. It is easy to refuel. It is warm to hot. And now, as we speak, the 5 ft extension hose just arrived. When connected from my Gas Buddy to a 20 lb propane tank, I should get at least 24 hrs of constant heat. Thank you for your time. ', 'The last power outage we only had kerosene heaters.  They are big, bulky, heavy, require pouring fuel and the fumes left us wheezing and coughing.  Therefore, we found these Mr. Heater, bought two and what a difference.  Small enough to be moved from room to room and so much safer.  You will love Mr Heater.', ""Small and practical for portable heat when equipped with a disposable bottle, it's even great for a more permanent heat source - just pair this heater up with a hose and a large refillable propane bottle.  It even has a pilot light for easy on and off use.  Two heat settings, 4000 and 9000 BTUs.  The back of the heater stays cool to the touch, so it can be used backed against a wall.  Six stars for this heater."", 'Really nice heater. Relatively easy to operate and has safety features. Heater will not run all night, though with the small propane cylinders. ', ""Love this portable propane heater. Can't wait to take it camping. In the meantime, we use it around the house to warm up and enjoy the heat it produces. If the power goes out, we will stay warm with this heater!"", ""This is a very good product.  What is different about Mr. Heater compared to other small heaters is that it uses 1 lb. propane tanks, thus it does not have to be plugged in or placed near an electrical outlet.  It is easy to use and have a anti tip safety feature that will cut the unit off if the unit is tipped.  Keep on hand a few 1 lb. propane cylinders, and you're good to go.  Very good heater for small spaces and can be used indoors."", 'Great propane heater with 2 settings. I also bought a 12ft hose to connect to a 5 Gallon propane tank. The low setting was enough to warm my 29ft motor home. Perfect.', 'Purchased the additional Mr. Heater 10\' hose (item F273704) that you don\'t have to use a filter and connected it to a 20 lb. bottle of propane.   Easy to light and ran all night on low to keep my greenhouse warm.  I used a 1.5"" PVC water pipe and ran the pipe under the foundation of my greenhouse and then ran the hose through it outside where the tank was located.  For safety reasons, you aren\'t supposed to have the 20 lb. tank inside near the heater.  I cut up an old wash cloth and stuck it inside the pvc pipe to keep bugs and cold air from entering into my greenhouse. So easy to do.  ', 'Product operates exactly as advertised, which nowadays is not always the case. It functions easily and simply. Really like the option to go to larger capacity tank for longer use periods or not having to change out bottles constantly.']","New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable).

Road Pro 12-Volt Direct Hook-Up Ceramic Heater/ Fan with Swivel Base RPSL_681,39.99, ,"["" As my house was damaged in a recent mudslide, I'm living in an insulated shed, and my power system consists of 6 golf cart batteries, an inverter and an inverter generator.  I ordered this item so that I could heat the shed without running the generator or inverter. As an electronic technician, I also disassembled it to see what quality it was, and how easy it would be to add a thermostat to it.  It's nicely made, has a good quality, quiet fan, and uses a relay to control the heater element, which means less wear and tear on it's control switch, and easy to modify for a thermostat.  It works well, and is quite adequate to get the 8x10 shed comfy when it's low 40s outside. I haven't modified it yet. Draws about 25amps. Heats up in a minute or two, and puts out a pleasant warm breeze. It's running as I type. Unlike a lot of those cheap window defroster units, it's a solid, well built product that will last, puts out a decent level of heat and doesn't sound like it's about to self-destruct any second like those cheap units.  Computer style fan should last for years..  Quite pleased with this product. "", ""I purchase one of these becausenthey are advertised well. It seemed to be my best bet when the heat in my work truck went bad and I didn't have $1,000 at that time to fix it. We only had a few more weeks of winter left so I figured this would get me through. WRONG! First of all these couldn't warm a person up nor warm the passenger compartment of any vehicle even if left running for a week(seven(7) straight days). Not to mention after only three(3) times of turning it on in an attempt to lessen the cold ride to work the thing just completely pucked out on me. I decided to take it apart to see why the most expensive aftermarket 12v vehicle heater crapped out on me. Well simply put everythong about it was just cheap. The thin guage wires used in the internal workings of this heater I think are a hazard. They would never handle the current needed to warm the heating element. I'm very thankful that my mistake of purchasing this unit didn't end way worse. Because the sheer lack of quality is dangerous, it easily could have caught my truck on fire. Terrible quality! BEWARE - WARNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY - This heater is just like throwing cash in the trash can!"", 'I use these units to heat my tractor cab. You definitely want to be sure you wire heavy enough to handle the load (#12). Then if you lose heat capability and you feel you have the ability, open it up and check the wiring where the power comes in. They have a tendency to unwire and that is an Achilles Heel. I had to beef up my last one and then it worked fine.', 'I bought this because the heater in my truck doesn\'t work. I used this heater exactly 3 times for a total less than 3 hours, and it burned up. The nasty stench of burning wires  and choking smoke filled the cab I had to pull over on a cold winter morning on the way to work and get out of the truck to get away from the nautiuos smell.. DON""T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  And I am being nice  calling it crap! ', ""At first I was very happy with the heater.  My heater in my car wasn't working so I bought this as a temporary fix until I could get it repaired.  It was easy to hook up and warmed my car's interior quite well.  Then after a few days it stopped making any heat.  It now just blows cold air."", 'received heater on time,looked exactly as picture in ad,works ok so far,wish fan was stronger,but i am pleased overall', ""Doesn't put out a lot of heat but does require a lot of power in it's attempt. Buries 1700 CCA of battery in a couple of hours. Need's continuous amp input to maintain a lesser rate of discharge. And if you're going to have to run your engine anyway might as well use your regular heat source of hot water.Unit is well constructed though, and of a clean, compact design."", 'fan is separate from heater, if you want heat  the fan does not work', ""I purchased this as auxillary heat for my snowblower tractor because when cold out, my tractor won't throw heat.  I like the easy installation, small size, nice looking, but it won't throw very much heat.  The fan will not kick out the heat that is being producted."", 'Should you buy this product?
